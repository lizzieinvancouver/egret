## Updated October 21, 2024
We use WorldFlora package to check for species names. To do this, you need to download the World Flora Online Taxonomic Backbone data which is available here:https://www.worldfloraonline.org/downloadData
\
\
The backbone data used in cleanSpecies.R was downloaded on October 1, 2024
\
\
We did not upload this backbone data to this repo because the file size limitation.
\
\
Once you download the backbone data (a csv file), you can change line#14 to read in the backbone data and run the rest of the code.
