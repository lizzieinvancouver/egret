"'Growth habit, occurrence, and uses. Mountain andromeda-Pieris floribunda (Pursh) Benth. & Hook.-is a broadleaf, evergreen, erect shrub 1 to 2 m in height and of equal or greater spread (Kruse 1987). The plant forms a rounded or flat-topped shape when mature and is covered with dense medium green foliage (Sabuco 1990). This species is indigenous to the Appalachian Mountains of the United States, extending from West Virginia southward into northern Georgia (Judd 1982). Mountain andromeda has a limited and scattered distribution along the Blue Ridge Mountains in the southern Appalachians (Spongberg 1990). It is typically found on mountain balds at high elevations and is hardy to USDA Zone 4 (Dirr 1990; Radford and oth- ers 1968). The species is rare in cultivation, due in part to difficul- ties in propagation. This handsome, evergreen shrub has sev- eral desirable landscape attributes: a dense, compact growth habit; white, upright inflorescences; a tolerance of higher soil pH (pH 7.5) than typical for species in the Ericaceae; a greater cold tolerance than shown by other species in Pieris D. Don; and resistance to leaf damage by lacebug- Stephanitis takeyai Drake and Maa. (Kruse 1987; Sabuco 1990). The plant is best suited for landscape use in lightly shaded sites with a well-drained soil high in organic matter (Kruse 1987). Geographic races and hybrids. There is only 1 known interspecific hybrid of mountain andromeda-Pieris 'Brouwer's Beauty'. The hybrid resulted spontaneously when a plant of Pieris floribunda was pollinated by nearby plants of Japanese andromeda-Pieris japonica (Thunb.) D. Don ex G. Don (Jaynes and Dunbar 1976). The resultant hybrid has morphological characteristics that are intermedi- ate between both parents (Jaynes 1975). The interspecific hybrid has an increased numbers of flowers that may be attributed to the sterility of the plant (Jaynes 1975). Lack of","'Flowering and fruiting. Fragrant, white flowers are borne on upright panicles that open beginning in late March and last until early May. Inflorescences are held well above the leaves at the top of the shrub, where they can be seen easily (Sabuco 1990). The floral display will last from 4 to 6 weeks. After flowering and a flush of new vegetative growth, the plant develops the inflorescences for the next year. Decorative, greenish white flower buds are produced in midsummer and stand out from the foliage during the fall and winter (Hillier Nurseries 1994). These panicles of buds serve to extend the period of landscape interest of this shrub. Flowers are pollinated by small bees (Gibson 1901). Fruits are globular, dry, 5-chambered, dehiscent, capsules borne in clusters, each 1 about 3 mm in diameter (Bailey 1977). Seeds are 3 mm long and 1.5 mm wide, are flattened with 2 inconspicuous wings, and have a dark golden-yellow color (figures 1 and 2). Collection of fruits, seed extraction, cleaning, and storage. Capsules and seeds ripen in mid- to late autumn and can be collected at that time (Kruse 1987). Capsules are removed from the plant, lightly beaten and rubbed to open them completely (Dirr and Heuser 1987), and then shaken to loosen the seeds. Viability can be poor if seeds are not grad- ed rigorously. Use of an air column blower is recommended to remove chaff and empty seeds (Starrett and others 1992). When dried to a moisture content of 6% and cleaned, the number of pure seeds was 7,500/g (210,000/oz) (Starrett and others 1992). Seeds of mountain andromeda are orthodox in storage behavior. They can be stored at room temperature if used within a year but can remain viable for several years if stored in a sealed container at 4.5 Â°C (Blazich and Starrett 1996). Germination tests. There are no test methods pre- scribed for official seed tests of mountain andromeda, but",
