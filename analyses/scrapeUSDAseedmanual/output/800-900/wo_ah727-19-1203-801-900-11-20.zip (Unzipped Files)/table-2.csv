"'Guatemala, the var. chiapensis Martinez (Chiapas white pine) (Critchfield and Little 1966; Wendel and Smith 1990). Within the var. strobus, seeds from western sources are lighter than those from eastern sources, and seeds from southern sources require longer times in stratification than seeds from northern ones (Fowler and Dwight 1964; Krugman and Jenkinson 1974; Mergen 1963). Seedlings grown from eastern seed sources had blue-green foliage in fall; seedlings of northwestern sources had yellow-green foliage (Wright and others 1963). Trees from sources in the southern Appalachian Mountains tend to grow faster and continue shoot elongation longer in autumn than trees from northern seed sources (Fowler and Heimburger 1969; Wright 1970). Artificial freezing studies and field observations in the northern Great Lakes region showed that seedlings from northern sources are less sensitive to cold than seedlings from southern sources (Krugman and Jenkinson 1974; Mergen 1963). Geographic differences in flower production, winter injury, susceptibility to blister rust, and sensitivity to air pollution are also known (Wendel and Smith 1990; Wright and others 1979). Horticultural varieties have been described (Waxman 1977). Pinus sylvestris-Scots pine is the most widely planted introduced pine species in the United States, especially in the Northeast, Great Lakes region, central states, and the Pacific Northwest. It is now is naturalized in parts of New England and the Great Lakes region (Skilling 1990). The pine with the greatest natural range of all the pines, it grows in a host of different ecological situations, was involved in the first comparative seed source trials of pine, and is likely the most intensively studied of all pines. Its geographic vari- eties conservatively number from 21 to 52, and numerous forms and ecotypes have been described. Abundant variation exists within varieties, and seed sources differ in many traits, including flowering; needle, cone, and seed color; seed size, dormancy, and germination rate; root system structure, seedling and tree growth rate and form, and sus- ceptibility to heat, cold, and drought (Brown 1969; Genys 1976; Giertych 1976; Pravdin 1964; Read 1971; Steven and Carlisle 1959; Wright 1962; Wright and others 1966). Seed size decreases from south to north, ranging from 97,240 seeds/kg (44,200/lb) in Spain to 279,400/kg (127,000/lb) in Lapland (Heit 1969). Seeds from sources in the extreme northern parts of the range and certain areas in Greece and Turkey show the highest seed dormancy (Heit 1969). Incompletely developed embryos explain part of the dor- mancy of northern sources (Kamra 1969). Growth rate typically decreases and cold hardiness increases from south to north. Trees from Finnish and Russian sources survived","'better in prairie conditions in Canada than did trees from more southern sources (Cram and Brack 1953). In Michigan, trees from certain French sources grew 3 times taller than trees from northern sources from Finland and Siberia, but northern sources were more cold hardy than southern ones (Wright 1962; Wright and others 1966). Needles of trees with origins in Asia Minor, the Balkans, southern France, and Spain remained green in winter, whereas those with Siberian and Scandinavian origins turned yellow. In Sweden, seeds from sources at north lati- tudes or high elevations germinated well over a wider range of temperatures than did seeds from sources at south lati- tudes or low elevations, and seedlings trees of southern sources grew faster and later in autumn than trees of north- ern sources (Kamra and Simak 1968). Trees from introduced sources produced better trees than did local sources in some European localities (Vidacovic 1991). Pinus taeda-Loblolly pine, commercially the most important forest tree in the southern United States, has repeatedly demonstrated important geographic variation in seedling and tree survival, growth rate, cold hardiness, drought hardiness, and disease resistance (Baker and Langdon 1990; Dorman 1976; Dorman and Zobel 1973). Local seed sources have often proved to be the best. Seedlings from southern sources are more prone to cold damage than those from northern ones, and seedlings grown from seeds from west of the Mississippi River are more drought tolerant and disease resistant than those from most sources east of the Mississippi. Seedlings from Maryland sources tend to grow less than those from other sources when planted in different areas (Wells 1969; Wells and Wakeley 1966). Trees of southern sources outgrew trees of northern sources in South Africa (Sherry 1947). Pinus thunbergiana-Japanese black pine of inland ori- gin show better growth form than those of coastal origin (Krugman and Jenkinson 1974). Pinus torreyana-Torrey pines with mainland California origins in a planting on the California mainland had a single trunk and grew taller than trees with a Santa Rosa Island ori- gin, which were bushy and branched freely. Trees from the Santa Rosa Island source produced larger cones (Haller 1967). The populations differ morphologically and biochem- ically as well (Ledig and Conkle 1983). Pinus virginiana-Virginia pine has no known varieties or races, but populations in the Talledega Mountains of cen- tral Alabama and on deep sands of the mid-Atlantic Coast conceivably are distinct ecotypes (Carter and Snow 1990; Dorman 1976; Kellison and Zobel 1974).
