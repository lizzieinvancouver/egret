"'losses to birds and rodents, and they must be delayed until the soils are cold enough to prevent germination in fall and avoid winter freeze damage and mortality of germinants. Seeds can be drill-sown or broadcast by hand or machine, but mechanized nurseries drill-sow in prepared seedbeds because it is most efficient and economical (Thompson 1984). Quantity of seeds sown per unit area of nursery bed varies with species, seed size, expected germi- nation and emergence percentages, and the target seedling density, that is, stems per unit bed area. Sowing density con- trols seedling density, which markedly affects both the size and vigor of seedlings and transplants. Target density depends on species and stock type, on when seedlings are to be lifted and on whether they are to be transplanted. Seeds are sown at rates that are selected to produce from 160 to 800 seedlings/m² (15 to 75/ft2). Higher seedling sur- vivals are obtained when medium and lower densities are used. Most nurseries SOW seeds at slightly higher densities if the seedlings are to be grown in transplant beds for 1 or 2 additional years, and higher sowing densities are used for 1+0 than for 2+0 seedlings. Sowing densities range from 61 to 610 g of seeds/10 m² (2 to 20 oz/100 ft2) of bed, depend- ing on species, nursery, and seedlot. To produce 2+0 plant- ing stock of western white pine, for example (Krugman and Jenkinson 1974), one western nursery drill-sows 115 seeds/m (35/ft) in rows spaced 9 cm (3 1/4 in) apart to get 1,290 seedlings/m² (120/ft2), whereas another drill-sows 60 seeds/m (18/ft) in rows spaced 15 cm (6 in) apart to get 375 seedlings/m² (35/ft2). Experience is the ultimate guide to sowing density for a given species and seed source in a par- ticular nursery situation. Seed germination in the nursery has varied from just 20 to 85% of that obtained in laboratory tests. On average, 55% of the seeds germinated in nursery beds, with a range of 19 to 90%, have yielded acceptable seedlings. At sowing time, seeds are drilled or pressed firmly into the soil and then uniformly covered with 3 to 19 mm (1/8 to 3/4 inch) of soil, sand, or other mulch, with depth depending on seed size and the nursery (table 11). Fall-sown seeds are set slightly deeper than spring-sown seeds to protect them against frost heaving and wind erosion. For large-seeded pines such as whitebark and sugar pines and singleleaf pinyon, seeds may be covered to a depth of 13 mm (1/2 inch). Seeds of small-seeded pines require the least cover- ing. Seeds of the southern pines-such as shortleaf, slash, longleaf, loblolly, and Virginia pines-are pressed into the soil surface and covered with burlap or chopped pine straw. Mulching protects seeds against rain displacement, helps protect against predations by birds, and slows evaporative loss of soil moisture. Seeds of shore, Rocky Mountain lodgepole, Japanese red, and Japanese black pines are typi-","'cally sown 3 mm (1/8 in) deep, and seeds of jack, Canary Island, and western white pines as well pinyon, 6 mm (1/4 in) deep. Sowing seeds deeper than advised is to be avoided, because deep sowing at best delays and often disables seedling emergence. Germination of most pines is completed 10 to 50 days after spring-sowing. Pretreated dormant seeds of certain lots of whitebark, Swiss stone, Balkan, and southwestern white pines, however, have taken from several months to a year to germinate after sowing (Krugman and Jenkinson 1974). Fungicides are often needed during and after seedling emergence to limit damping-off in most nurseries, and both insecticide and fungicide sprays are needed during the grow- ing season to control insects and foliar diseases. Repeated nursery applications of fungicides are needed to control fusiform rust (Cronartium quercuum (Bark.) Miy. ex Shirai f. sp. fusiforme Bards. et Snow) on slash and loblolly pines and brown spot (Scirrhia acicola (Dearn.) Sigg.) on longleaf pines in southern United States, and to control sweetfern blister rust (Cronartium comptoniae Arth.) on jack, pon- derosa, and Scots pines in the Great Lakes region (Krugman and Jenkinson 1974). Transplants and older planting stock types are generally recommended for more difficult planting sites (table 11). In the Great Lakes regions and the prairie-plains, stock types used for jack pine are 1+0 or 1+1/2 for usual sites; 1+1 or 2+0 for tough sites; and 1+2, 2+1, or 2+2 for windbreaks. Stock types used for most white pines are 2+0 and 3+0, or 2+1 and 2+2 transplants. Pines are also routinely grown in specialized container nurseries. In general, seeds are sown or new germinants are transplanted in containers filled with a standard rooting medium or soil mix, partial shade is provided during seed germination and seedling establishment phases, and seedlings are cultured for 1 growing season before planting. Care must be taken not to grow pines in too small containers for prolonged times, as they become rootbound and grow poorly after planting. Container-grown longleaf pine has performed exceptionally well in the South (Brissette and others 1991), and this species is now widely regenerated with container stock. A vast literature details every aspect of container stock production which is fully captured in the 6 current volumes in the Container Tree Nursery Manual (Agric. Handbk. 674) (Landis and others 1989, 1990a&b, 1992, 1994, 1999). An updated directory of forest tree nurs- eries in the United States indicates their ownership (private, industry, state, federal, and other), location by state, stock offered (bareroot, container, rooted cuttings), and amount shipped in fall 1992-spring 1993 (Okholm and Abriel 1994).",
