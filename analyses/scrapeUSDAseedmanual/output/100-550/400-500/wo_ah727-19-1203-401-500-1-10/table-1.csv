"'rabbitbrush genus-Chrysothamnus spp.-are among the best-known of western shrubs (Johnson 1987; McArthur and Welch 1986; McArthur and others 2004, 1979). The genus is endemic to western North America and is made up of 16 species (Anderson 1986; McArthur and Meyer 1987). It has recently been partially subsumed under the new genus Ericameria, formerly an infraspecific taxon within the related genus Haplopappus (Anderson 1995; USDA NRCS 2001). Because the durability of this nomenclatural change has yet to be demonstrated, the decision here is to follow the traditional nomenclature (table 1). Rabbitbrush commonly occurs on sites of natural or human disturbances such as washes, drainage-ways, and quarries; they may also occur as subdominants in later seral vegetation. Their conspicuous golden flowers are a familiar sight in autumn along roadsides throughout the West. Three of the species-rubber rabbitbrush, Parry rabbitbrush, and green rabbitbrush-are widespread, polymorphic taxa made up of multiple subspecies, whereas the remainder are taxo- nomically simpler and more restricted in distribution. Rubber rabbitbrush is made up of 22 subspecies, many of which are ecologically distinctive. Its more ecologically specialized subspecies are restricted to dunes, rock out- crops, shale badlands, alkaline bottomlands, or montane riparian communities. Most of the widely distributed sub- species are also broad in their ecological requirements but tend to be commonest on disturbed ground. Common gar- den studies have shown that marked ecotypic differentiation occurs within subspecies for such traits as growth form, growth rate, cold and drought hardiness, competitive ability, flowering time, achene weight, and germination patterns (McArthur and others 1979; Meyer 1997; Meyer and others 1989). Such ecotypic variation is to be expected in other widely distributed species as well. It is therefore important to consider ecotype as well as species and subspecies when selecting seed sources for artificial seeding projects.","'vary widely in their palatability to livestock and wildlife. Certain unpalatable taxa such as threadleaf rubber rabbit- brush tend to increase on abused rangeland, and consider- able energy has been invested in control methods (Whisenant 1987). A tendency to resprout after herbicide spraying, chopping, or burning, combined with an ability to reestablish from seeds, can make rabbitbrush difficult to eradicate (Young and Evans 1974). Basin and mountain whitestem rubber rabbitbrush races are highly palatable as winter forage for deer (Odocoileus spp.), sheep, and cattle, and have been included in seeding mixes for the rehabilitation of big game winter range for over 30 years (Monsen and Stevens 1987). Other species and subspecies also provide winter forage for wildlife and livestock (McArthur and others 2004). Rabbitbrushes are extensively used for mined-land rehabilitation in the West (Romo and Eddleman 1988). Thousands of pounds of wild- land-collected seed are bought and sold annually (McArthur and others 2004; Monsen and others 2004, 1987). Rabbitbrushes may be seeded as pioneer species on harsh mine disturbances for erosion control and site amelioration and often invade such sites on their own (Monsen and Meyer 1990). They can act as nurse plants to facilitate estab- lishment of later seral species, as they generally offer little competition to perennial grasses or later seral shrubs (Frischknecht 1963). Rabbitbrushes have potential uses in landscape plant- ings, especially with the recent emphasis on xeriscaping. Rubber rabbitbrush has also been examined as a commercial source of natural rubber and other plant secondary metabo- lites such as resins (Weber and others 1987). Flowering and fruiting. The perfect yellow disk flowers of rabbitbrushes usually occur in groups of 5 in nar- rowly cylindrical heads subtended by elongate, often keeled bracts. The heads are numerous and are clustered in often flat-topped terminal or lateral inflorescences that can be",
