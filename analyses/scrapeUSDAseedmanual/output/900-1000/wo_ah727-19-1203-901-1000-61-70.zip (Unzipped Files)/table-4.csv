"'Growth habit, occurrence, and use. The locust genus-Robinia-includes 9 species, with 8 varieties native to the United States and Canada (BONAP 1996). Four species, 6 varieties, and 4 hybrids are considered here (table 1). Most of these species are shrubs and a few are deciduous trees. Black locust is a medium-sized tree 12 to 18 m high with a maximum of 30 m (Roach 1965). It reaches its best development in the Appalachian region and has been widely planted in the Western Hemisphere and Europe. The rapid growth of black locust on good sites, its nitrogen-fixing abil- ity, and the durability of its wood (especially for fence posts) makes black locust one of the most valuable species in the genus. Bristly locust and its variety Kelsey locust are low shrubs, 0.6 to 3 m high (Fernald 1950). They are useful for erosion control because of prolific root sprouting. Growth of locust species is very good on calcareous soils, but bristly locust will grow also on strip mine spoils, where acid soils have pH values as low as 4.0. Bristly locust is a triploid and Kelsey locust is a diploid (Whitaker 1934). New Mexican locust is a small tree, 3 to 7.5 m high (Wooten 1913).","'canvas or plastic sheets from late August throughout the winter (table 2). The legumes should be spread out to air-dry until they are brittle to facilitate breaking them open. Alternatively, they can be dried in a forced-air seed or cone drier if a faster result is needed or if natural drying condi- tions are too humid. Once the legumes are brittle, they can be threshed by flailing them in a bag or by running them through a macerator or brush machine (chapter 3 Chaff and light seeds can be removed by fanning or flotation in water. Legumes of New Mexican locust should be collected soon after ripening, because they open rapidly once ripening is complete (Olson 1974). Seed weights are similar among the locusts (table 3). Soundness and purity of seedlots is high. Seedlot purities of 97% and soundness of 90 to 99% have been obtained (Olson 1974). Locust seeds are orthodox in storage behavior. In prolonged storage, dry seeds retain their viability for 10 years or more if placed in closed containers at 0 to 4.5 Â°C. For periods of 3 to 4 years, open storage in a cool, dry place can be practiced (Olson 1974). Seeds can be stored dry and sown within a year (Wyman 1953). Pregermination treatment.
