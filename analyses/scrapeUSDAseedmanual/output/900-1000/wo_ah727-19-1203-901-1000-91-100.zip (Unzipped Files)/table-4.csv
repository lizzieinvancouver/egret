"'Growth habit, occurrence and use. The willow genus-Salix-includes 350 to 400 species (Argus 1996). The majority are in the Northern Hemisphere, from arctic through temperate latitudes (table 1). Three species are native south of Mexico (Dorn 1976) and 67 found in the contiguous 48 United States, where tree and shrub forms predominate. The 39 species found in Alaska are mostly tall to medium shrubs; prostrate growth forms are mostly on the tundra. Shrub and prostrate shrub forms constitute a domi- nant portion of the vegetation of the Circumpolar Arctic (defined as north of the treeline) and include about 29 species in the North American Arctic (Argus 1996). These tundra species are segregated into a variety of habitats (Argus 1973; Viereck and Little 1972). General information on the genus worldwide can be found in Warren-Wren (1972) and Newsholme (1992); the taxonomy and distribu- tion of American species is covered by Argus (1973, 1986, 1995), Dorn (1976), MacKinnon and others (1992), and Viereck and Little (1972). General reviews of ecological characteristics and effects of fire on more than 20 species are available in the Fire Effects Information System Database (Fisher 1992). Seed characteristics of poplar (Populus, the other North American genus in the Salicaceae) are very similar to those of willows, and information for poplar is applicable to willow (Schreiner 1974; Zasada and Wyckoff 2002). The uniformity in seed characteristics, par- ticularly germination, in the Salicaceae is remarkable con- sidering that the family comprises several hundred species. The importance of willows as a component of regional vegetation varies geographically and with the mix of habitat types within the region (Fisher 1992). In particular, willows become more important with increasing latitude in North America. In the boreal forests of northern Canada and Alaska, willows are the most common tall and intermediate shrubs; they fill niches occupied by hazel (Corylus spp.), maple (Acer spp.), and cherry and plum (Prunus spp.) in more southern parts of the boreal forest. In the tundra,","'willows are often the only woody species present; in riparian areas, they are, along with alder (Alnus spp.), the largest plants in these important tundra habitats. Willows have a variety of growth forms (Brinkman 1974; Newsholme 1992; Viereck and Little 1972; Warren- Wren 1972). The tallest attain heights of 30 m, whereas prostrate tundra willows attain heights of a few centimeters to little more than 30 cm. Crown spread and shape is vari- able; the weeping willow is a popular ornamental tree. ""Diamond" willow wood (of various species), named for the diamond-shaped stem lesions that expose the heartwood, is sought after in some areas for making furniture, walking canes, and lamp bases, and for ornamental woodwork. In natural regeneration, the relative importance of seed versus vegetative propagation varies between species and between locations for a given species (for example, feltleaf willow) (Bliss and Cantlon 1957; Moore 1982; Walker and others 1986). Under appropriate moisture conditions, seeds germinate and seedlings establish in riparian and upland habitats (Densmore and Zasada 1983; Krasny and others 1988; McBride and Strahan 1984; McLeod and McPherson 1972; Walker and others 1986; Zasada and others 1983). Mineral soil is the most suitable substrate because of its water-holding characteristics, but other substrates are ade- quate if water is available. After seedling establishment, some species (coyote willow and related species) develop clones by suckering from root systems and others by down- ward bending and layering of stems and branches; however, most species capture space by crown expansion from a multiple-stemmed clump (Douglas 1989; Krasny and others 1988; Ottenbreit and Staniforth 1992). Some species are important colonizers in early stages of primary succession on floodplains, whereas others colonize in later stages of floodplain succession (Argus 1973; Viereck 1970; Viereck and Little 1972; Walker and others 1986). The majority of species reproduce vegetatively. The most common form of vegetative regrowth is sprouting from",
