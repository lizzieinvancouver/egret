"'such as those grown in Crete, southern Greece, Egypt, Israel, and Tunisia, bloom and fruit heavily with very little winter chilling; whereas those originating in Italy, Spain, and California require substantial chilling for good fruiting. In experiments with the cultivars grown in California, optimum flowering occurred when the temperature fluctuat- ed daily between 15.5 to 19 °C maximum and 2 to 40 °C minimum. Trees held at a constant temperature of 13 °C also bloomed profusely but had poor pistillate flower forma- tion. If temperatures did not rise above 7.5 °C or fall below 15.5 °C, trees did not bloom. At 13 °C, both chilling and warmth are sufficient for flowering but not for complete flower development. In contrast to flower buds, vegetative buds of olive seem to have little if any dormancy, growing whenever the temperatures are much above 21 °C. In addi- tion to winter chilling, inflorescence formation requires leaves on the fruiting shoots. Therefore, it is important to prevent defoliation. The occasional occurrence of hot, dry winds during the blooming period has been associated with reduced fruit set. Winds or heat increase the amount of natu- ral abscission. Prolonged, abnormally cold weather during April and May, when the olive flower buds should be developing rap- idly, can have a detrimental effect on subsequent flowering, pollination, and fruit set. Such weather occurred in California in the spring of 1967, delaying bloom by several weeks and leading to flower abnormalities and a crop of only 14,000 tons, the lightest in modern California history. In California, fruit on the tree by July 1, as a rule, continue on to maturity. At full bloom, flowers are delicately poised for pollina- tion, when some 500,000 flowers are present in a mature tree; a commercial crop of 7 metric tons/ha (3 tons/ac) or more can be achieved when 1 or 2% of these flowers remain as developing fruit. By 14 days after full bloom, most of the flowers destined to abscise have done SO. By that time, about 494,000 flowers have abscised from a tree that started with 500,000 flowers. Olives are polygamo-monoecious. The flowers are born axially along the shoot in panicles. The panicles of 'Barouni', 'Manzanillo', 'Mission', and 'Sevillano' carry an average of 12 to 18 flowers; ""Ascolano" average 20 flowers. Perfect flowers, those with both pistillate and staminate parts, normally consist of a small calyx, 4 petals, 2 stamens and filaments supporting large pollen-bearing anthers, and a plum-green pistil with a short thick style and a large stigma. Perfect flowers are borne apically in an inflorescence, and within the typical triple-flower inflorescence the middle flower is generally perfect. Imperfect flowers are staminate,","'with the pistil either lacking or rudimentary. Flowers with abortive anthers also occur and are common in 'Sevillano'. Cultivars vary, but most abscission occurs soon after full bloom and final fruit set nearly always occurs within 6 weeks of full bloom. Further fruit abscission can result from pest infestation and environmental extremes. When trees have an inflorescence at nearly every leaf axil a commercial crop occurs with 1 to 2% fruit set; with a small population of inflorescence, a commercial crop may require 10% fruit set. ""Shotberries" (parthenocarpic fruits) occur randomly and for reasons not clearly understood. When shotberries occur, they may be seen in clusters on each inflorescence. Here the interfruit competition for raw materials differs from that of normal olive fruits. Shotberries mature much earlier than normal fruit and may be more prevalent when condi- tions favor a second large crop in succession. The endocarp (pit) enlarges to full size and hardens by 6 weeks after full bloom. At that time, the endosperm begins to solidify and embryo development takes place, leading to embryo maturity by September. The mesocarp (flesh) and exocarp (skin) continue their gradual growth. The fruits begin changing from the green color to yellow-white (straw) and accumulate anthocyanin from the distal or base end. The purple to black color eventually bleeds into the mesocarp, signaling fruit overmature for the California black-ripe or green-ripe processing. As has been reported for most other fruit crops, trees with few fruits mature their crops earlier than trees with many fruits. Collection, extraction, storage, and germination of seeds. For seed production, the fruits should be harvested when ripe, but before they turn black. This period extends from late September to mid-November, depending on the cultivar (Largarda and others 1983a&b). Pits are removed from the flesh of the fruit with macerators. Pits can be stored in a dry place for years or planted directly, but germi- nation is slow and uneven. Pregermination treatments are designed to overcome both seedcoat (mechanical) and embryo dormancies. Mechanical or chemical scarification is used to treat mechanical dormancy. In scarification, the endocarp can be cracked mechanically or clipped at the radi- cle end, with care taken not to damage the embryo. Clipping just the cotyledonary end of the endocarp does not improve germination. Good germination results can be obtained using a seed cracking device before subsequent handling procedures (Martin and others 1986). Pits may be soaked in concentrated sulfuric acid to soften the endocarp. Soaking time depends on the thickness of the endocarp; typical soak- ing times for 'Manzanillo' are between 24 and 30 hours.
