"'sites but do thrive on slightly acidic and moist but well- drained soils. Of all the species, Serbian spruce may best tolerate industrial air pollution (Dallimore and Jackson 1967). Geographic races and superior strains. The wide ranges and diverse environments to which the spruce species have adapted provide an array of individual, ecological, and geographic variations. Natural hybridization and introgres- sion commonly occur where ranges of compatible species overlap. Hybridization between white spruce and Sitka spruce (first reported by Little 1953 as P. X lutzii), occurs in British Columbia and throughout the Kenai Peninsula in Alaska (Copes and Beckwith 1977). This hybrid has demon- strated a genetically based resistance to attack by the Sitka spruce weevil-Pissodes strobi Peck-which causes severe height growth and stem form reduction in Sitka spruce (Mitchell and others 1990). Hybridization between white spruce and Engelmann spruce occurs in northern Montana and British Columbia (Daubenmire 1974). Artificial crosses of Engelmann spruce with Sitka spruce and with blue spruce suggest the close relatedness of these North American species (Fowler and Roche 1977). Electrophoresis has yet to clearly identify hybrids of Engelmann spruce and blue spruce along a 1,200-m elevational transect in the front range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains, where the species grow together. Morphological similarity between the 2 species, such as number of bud scales, number of stomatal rows, and location of resin sacs, however, suggests either convergent evolution or the influence of environmental vari- ation on the morphological characters (Mitton and Andalora 1981). Natural introgression between the maritime Sitka spruce and the more interior complex of white and Engelmann spruces occurs in a portion of British Columbia, and the hybrid fraction was estimated by restriction frag- ment length polymorphisms of the nuclear ribosomal RNA genes (Sutton and others 1994). Differences in monoterpene composition from black spruce oleoresin (including a-pinene, 3-carene, and terpinolene) vary among geo- graphic origins in an east-west pattern, except for seeds from sources in New England that have close affinity in monoterpene composition to red spruce (Chang and Hanover 1991). Natural introgression of black spruce into red spruce may result in greater height and diameter growth in New Brunswick, yet the hybrid performed unpredictably in managed stands (Fowler and others 1988). Early crosses within the genus have provided a thorough background in potential crossability of the genus, including specimens from artificial crosses between nonsympatric species (Wright 1955). Analysis of morphological character- istics and monoterpene composition from artificial crosses","'between white, red, and blue spruces later verified the hybridity of the seedlings, evaluated the utility of spruce hybrids, and clarified the evolutionary relation among mem- bers of the genus (Bongarten and Hanover 1982). Height growth of Englemann spruce X Sitka spruce hybrids proved unsuitable for reforestation purposes in the north central interior of British Columbia (Kiss 1989). Hybrids of black spruce and Serbian spruce out-performed the black spruce parents in height and diameter growth and can be produced sexually en masse in seed orchards (Fowler 1980). Seed source identification and provenance testing of native as well as exotic spruce species are important in selecting suitable races for various purposes. Seeds intended for use in artificial reforestation usually are collected from ""superior" trees growing in the same area that is to be replanted. Measurements of phenology and growth-both adaptive characters closely related to survival and optimal utilization of the growing season-indicated a clinal varia- tion pattern with photoperiod and temperature as primary factors in 100 seed sources of black spruce from natural stands in Alaska to Newfoundland. A 1Â° shift in latitude changed the seedlings' total height 2 to 11% (Morgenstern 1978). On a smaller scale, clinal variation in black spruce in the maritime provinces resulted in 3 overlapping breeding zones (Park and Fowler 1988). Within the range of black spruce, extensive gene flow between stands discourages for- mation of distinctive provenances. Phenotypic characteristics of cones, needles, twigs, percentage survival, and growth generally differ more within-populations than between-pop- ulations (Fowler and Mullin 1977; Parker and others 1983; Thomson and others 1990). In Alberta, black spruce popula- tions growing on strongly contrasting environments, such as uplands adjacent to peatlands, exhibited similarity in isozyme variability (Wang and MacDonald 1992). In con- trast, populations near the margins of the range, such as coastal regions in Newfoundland, better reflected prove- nance effects (Khalil 1984; Yeh and others 1986). Genetic variation of Engelmann spruce may correlate with latitude and elevation; the species grows at 762 to 1,067 m in British Columbia and as high as 3,658 m in the southern Rocky Mountains (Alexander 1987). After 10 years, seedlings from more northern and lower elevation sources grew better than those from other sources within this wide geographical and elevational distribution when planted together at 2,930 m in central Colorado (Shepperd and others 1981). Lack of genetic variation of red spruce at the provenance level suggests a single broad seed and breed- ing zone for the maritime provinces (Fowler and others 1988). Genetic variation in natural populations of blue spruce has received considerable attention and seems to con- form to a discontinuous (rather than clinal) pattern with extensive stand-to-stand and individual-tree variation",
