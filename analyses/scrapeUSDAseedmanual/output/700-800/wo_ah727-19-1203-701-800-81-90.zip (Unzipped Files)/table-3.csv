"'Growth habit, occurrence, and use. The genus Physocarpus includes about 6 species of deciduous, spiraea- like shrubs with exfoliating bark, alternate and lobed leaves resembling Ribes, and small white to pinkish flowers in corymbs. The common name, ninebark, probably refers to the use of the plant in a number of medicinal cures (Stokes 1981) or the numerous layers of bark that peel off (Strausbaugh and Core 1978). Five species are native to North America, and one is introduced from Asia (table 1). Three subspecies of dwarf ninebark-P. alternans ssp. alter- nans, P. a. ssp. annulatus J.T. Howell, and P. a. ssp. panam- intensis J.T. Howell-are recognized (USDA NRCS 2001). Although the genus is not wide-spread, certain species may be locally abundant because of root sprouting. Atlantic ninebark and common ninebark, 2 varieties of opulifolius the specific epithet refers to Viburnum opulus, an introduced species from Europe (Stokes 1981)-are the most common species in the eastern United States and are found along streams, riverbanks, and moist hillsides. Atlantic ninebark grows to 1.5 m, whereas common ninebark may be twice that height. A dense, compact cultivar of Atlantic ninebark named 'Nugget' produces golden yellow foliage in the spring that matures to orange-bronze (Higginbotham 1990). Of the western species, dwarf ninebark is found mostly in rocky canyons and low-elevation forests of California and grows to 1 m in height; mountain ninebark is found from foothill forests to mountain tops of the central and southern Rocky Mountains and grows to 1 m in height; mallow ninebark is found in rocky canyons and low-elevation open forests throughout the Rocky Mountains and grows to 2 m; and Pacific ninebark is found in moist to wet lowlands or foothills mostly west of the Cascade Range and grows to 3 m. A prostrate and rhizomatous cultivar of Pacific ninebark named 'Tilden Park' grows to a height of 1.5 m (Straley 1989).","'Ninebark species and cultivars generally are hardy, do best in full sunlight or thin shade, and tolerate a wide vari- ety of soil types (Krüssmann 1985). They are used primari- ly as ornamentals in landscaping or for watershed protec- tion. Most of the species have been cultivated in the United States for nearly 100 years (table 1). In the wild, mallow ninebark sprouts prolifically from the root crown after spring and fall fires (Lea and Morgan 1993). Although the genus is reported to be remarkably free from insects and diseases (Everett 1981; Gill and Pogge 1974), at least 17 flower-eating, 63 leaf-and-stem-eating, and 4 seed-eating insects have been identified on common ninebark, including the flower-specialist mirids Plagiognathus punctatipes Knight and Psallus physocarpi Henry and seed-specialist torymids Megastigmus gahani Milliron and M. physocarpi Crosby (Wheller and Hoebeke 1985). Flowering and fruiting. Flowers are complete, regu- lar, and clustered together in terminal corymbs consisting of a few in mountain and mallow ninebarks, 3 to 6 in dwarf ninebark, and many in Pacific and common ninebarks. Flowers are from 0.5 to 1 cm in diameter, the corolla most- ly white, sometimes pinkish to light pink in Pacific and mountain ninebarks. The 5 sepals are densely stellate pubescent to tomentose, except in Pacific ninebark, where they are sometimes glabrous (Krüssmann 1985). Flowers of Pacific ninebark appear in April through June, those of mountain ninebark appear in May through June, and those of mallow and common ninebarks in June. The fruits are small, firm-walled, inflated follicles (fig- ure 1); the generic name Physocarpus is derived from the Greek physa (""bladder" or "bellows") and karpos ("fruit"), referring to the bladder-shaped follicles (Stokes 1981). Follicles range in size from 5 mm in dwarf ninebark to 11 mm in Pacific ninebark. They are solitary in dwarf ninebark and sometimes mountain ninebark; paired in mal- low ninebark and sometimes mountain ninebark; and",
