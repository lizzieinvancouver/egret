Description:
Data Scraping of the USDA Woody Seed Manual Via Amazon Textract
Feb. 10, 2024

By Sandy Zhang:

I found this aws tool as it claims to "Extract text and structured data such as tables and forms from documents using artificial intelligence". I tried playing with it using a pdf consisting of (Table 2 for Fagus on pg 520; Table 3 on pg 945, Table 5 for Fagus on pg 523; Table 3 for Aronia on pg 273), and the result is much better than chatGPT. Textract will parse all the tables and return each table as a separate CSV file along with the confidence score.
advantages:
a. In cases when the confidence score is too low, AWS will send the info to human review and return the result to Amazon S3 (the "Google Drive").
b. The process can be done manually or through an endpoint so the process can be made more automatically.
c. Free tier account can have the first 1000 pages for free and $1.5 per 1000 pages, much cheaper than chatGPT
disadvantages:
a. the parse CSV files will contain some confidence scores and format but can be cleaned by R
b. some fields/values may be missed or wrong, as AI can be error-prone. some manual effort is required to quickly scan through as validation.
