When will the human scraping ever end? I asked Will Pearse who said 'now' and then he tried to show me how amazing it was. 

### Overview of what we did ...
On 21 May 2025 Will told me we could use chatGPT to scrape the USDA Seed Manual now and it would be amazing. He suggested I grab pages from a chapter and he would show me. 

* I gave him: `Pages from USDA_woody_plant_seed_manual_2008.pdf` (Magnolia since I know Christophe RD found additional data in the text there)
* `ChatGPT.pdf` shows what I asked. 
* `Magnolia_Germination_Data.csv` shows what it extracted on the first try (see PDF for what I asked).
* `Expanded_Magnolia_Germination_Data.csv` shows what it extracted on the second try (see PDF for what I asked).
* `Newbold_etal_2024.pdf` is a paper Will suggested we read (especially Fig 1) to see what we'd need to do for this to go better.
