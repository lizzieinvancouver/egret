"'ed as sufficiently distinct to be placed in its own family. Jojoba is found from coastal and cis-montane southern California east to central Arizona and south to Sonora and Baja California (Munz 1974; Yermanos 1974). It is a charac- teristic plant of upland shrub communities in the Sonoran and Colorado Deserts and is also quite common as a compo- nent of chaparral. Jojoba is a sparsely branched, decumbent to erect shrub that grows to 2 or rarely 3 m in height. Its large (2- to 4-cm- long), opposite, entire leaves are evergreen, leathery, and dull gray. Plants are extremely tolerant of drought (Al-Ani and others 1972) and their foliage is a source of nutritious forage for sheep, goats, and cattle, as well as for wild ungu- lates and smaller browsers such as rabbits. The large seeds have been used locally as a food source by indigenous peo- ple (Brooks 1978). The most noteworthy feature of jojoba from a human perspective is the unusual liquid wax that makes up the stor- age reserve of its seeds. This substance, a fatty acid ester of a long-chain alcohol, is unique in the plant kingdom. It has chemical and rheological properties similar to those of sperm whale oil, which make it useful in a host of applica- tions (Brooks 1978). Interest in commercial production of jojoba seed was greatly increased in the mid-1970s, when import of sperm whale oil into the United States was banned. First efforts were focused on harvesting seeds from wildland stands, but it was soon realized that for cost-effec- tive production, cultivation in an agronomic setting would be necessary (Foster 1980; Yermanos 1979). Since that time, jojoba has been successfully cultivated in many semi-arid regions of the world (Ismail 1988; Kumari and others 1991;","'Flowering and fruiting. Jojoba is dioecious and relies on wind for successful pollination (Niklas and Buchmann 1985). The flowers, which are greenish yellow, inconspicuous, and without petals, are borne in the axils of the leaves. The male flowers are clustered at the nodes, and the female flowers are usually borne singly. Flowering occurs in March through May in response to winter rains. Plants of most populations appear to have a short (2-week) vernalization requirement for induction of flowering (Nord and Kadish 1974). Under plantation conditions, jojoba usu- ally begins producing seeds the second or third year after planting (Nord and Kadish 1974; Yermanos 1974). Seeds ripen during the summer. The endosperm is absent (figure 1), and the cotyledons (which function as the storage organs) contain about half of their weight as wax (Brooks 1978). Good seedcrops are produced at intervals of 2 to sev- eral years (Brooks 1978; Castellanos and Molina 1990). Some individuals appear to be genetically predisposed to be more productive than others, making selection for higher yield possible (Nord and Kadish 1974; Yermanos 1974). The 1 to 3 large seeds are borne in a capsule that super- ficially resembles an acorn. This splits open apically and down the sides to release the seeds. As is the case with many large-seeded North American desert species, jojoba seeds are dispersed by scatter-hoarding rodents that are also their principal consumers (Castellanos and Molina 1990). Sherbrooke (1976) reported that only 1 heteromyid species in southern Arizona-Bailey's pocket mouse (Peragnathus baileyi)-was able to utilize jojoba seeds. The seeds contain a unique toxic cyanogenic glucoside (simmondsin). He con- cluded that Bailey's pocket mouse had evolved a detoxifica-",
