The beds are lightly watering again after sowing, then covered with 1.3-cm (1/2-in) mesh hardware cloth and 50% shadecloth (Wyckoff 1996). Sowing is often done by hand: enough seeds to cover a given area of bed space are weighed out and sprinkled from vials with small holes drilled in the caps. Mechanical sowing is used where seeders capable of han- dling such small seeds are available. Seedbeds are watered from an overhead irrigation sys- tem as needed during the first 3 weeks to maintain a moist surface without runoff or standing water; the seedbed covers are left in place during irrigation. The shadecloth is removed","'(3- to 4-inch) tall seedlings are transplanted into seedbeds at densities of 43 to 54 seedlings/m² (4 to 5 seedlings/ft2 and grown for one season. On average, it requires 1.5 to 2 viable seeds to produce 1 container seedling with a minimum 5-mm (0.2-in) root collar diameter; 5 to 6 viable seeds to produce a bareroot seedling with a minimum 7-mm (0.3-in) root collar diameter; and 2.7 seeds to produce a plug+1 bareroot seedling with a minimum 7-mm (0.3-in) root collar diameter. Seedlings grown in the plug +1 regime attain heights of 1 m (3.2 ft) in a single growing season (Wyckoff 1996). The following features are common to all growing systems:",
