"'parviflora-Japanese pine thought to consist of 2 geographical varieties that merge in central Honshu (Critchfield and Little 1966). Several horticultural forms of the species are cultivated (Krüssmann 1960). Pinus patula-Mexican weeping pine grows rapidly and has been widely introduced. It grows well in Australia, New Zealand, and East Africa and has become an important source of wood in the summer-rainfall areas of South Africa (Leloup 1956; Loock 1950; Magini and Tulstrup 1955). Two varieties are known. The typical var. patula bears closed cones and has entirely black seeds. The var. longepeduncu- lata ssp. tecumumanii Loock, found in the Mexican states of Oaxaca and Chiapas, opens cones quickly at maturity and yields seeds that are black with brown marks (Loock 1950). Pinus peuce-Balkan pine of the best quality in Europe is believed to come from seed sources in the Rila and Pirin Mountains of Bulgaria (Müller 1932). Two distinct varieties have been identified, one in the mountains near Rodopes, Bulgaria, and the other in the western part of the species' range near Prokletije, Albania (Vidacovic 1991). Pinus pinaster-Maritime pine has 5 major races. The highly variable French or Atlantic race typically inhabits coastal sands. The Portuguese race also inhabits coastal sands, but surpasses the French race in tree form, growth rate, and drought resistance. It grew well in tests in South Africa and western Australia and appears to have dormant seeds (Hopkins 1960; Wright 1962). The Iberian Mountains race is continental and slow growing (Resch 1974). The Corsican race occurs mainly in the mountains. In the Moroccan race, trees grown from seeds of mountain origins differ from near-coastal ones, as trees grown from seeds of mountain origins fail when they are planted in coastal areas. Trees of more southern origins are highly susceptible to frost damage. Trees of mountain origins are believed to be frost resistant (Magini and Tulstrup 1955). Pinus ponderosa-Ponderosa pine, one of the most widely ranging pines in North America, has 2 distinct vari- eties: Pacific (var. ponderosa) and Rocky Mountain (var. scopulorum) Engelm. (Oliver and Ryker 1990). The varieties differ in a host of traits, including needle length and number per fascicle, xylem resin monoterpenes, cone and seed size, seed isozymes, seed dormancy and germination rate, season- al patterns of seedling top and root growth capacity (RGC), seedling and tree survival, growth rate, stem form, drought tolerance, cold hardiness, disease resistance, and susceptibil- ity to hail (Callaham 1962; Conkle and Critchfield 1988; Eldridge and Dowden 1980; Fowells 1965; Hoff 1988; Jenkinson 1976, 1980; Larson 1966; Read 1980, 1983; Read and Sprackling 1981; Rehfeldt 1986a&b; Smith 1977;","'Squillace 1962; 1986a; Wang 1977; Weidman 1939; Wells 1964). Interpretation of this vast genetic diversity suggests that there are 5 major geographic races, including 3 in var. pon- derosa and 2 in var. scopulorum (Conkle and Critchfield 1988). In var. ponderosa, the Pacific race occurs west of the crest of the Cascade Range-Sierra Nevada from northern Oregon to the transverse ranges in southern California; the southern California race ranges through the transverse- peninsular ranges; and the North Plateau race ranges along the east side of the Cascade Range-Sierra Nevada and extends east to the Continental Divide in Montana. In var. scopulorum, the Rocky Mountain race occurs in the north- east part of the species' range and joins the southwest race along a broad and ill-defined front in southern Colorado, Utah, and Nevada. Provenances within varieties and races differ in a host of traits. Seeds from sources in the Pacific Northwest, Rocky Mountain, and Southwest differed in germination rate at dif- ferent temperatures (Callaham 1962). In Oregon and Washington, growth rate generally increased with seed ori- gin from east to west, and from south to north in eastern parts of the range. Seeds from sources from eastern and southeastern parts of the range produced seedlings showing the slowest growth (Squillace and Silen 1962). In northern Arizona, seedlings from eastern and southeastern sources grew well, but those from northern and western sources and the southernmost one failed (Larson 1966). Northern sources of var. scopulorum showed comparatively good growth and frost resistance, while southern sources were slower growing but also frost resistant (Weidman 1939). In California, seedlings of var. ponderosa from sources west of the crest of the Cascade Range-Sierra Nevada grow faster but are more subject to frost injury than those from east of the crest (Krugman and Jenkinson 1974). Important differences exist between sources in adaptation to ultramafic soils on the west slope (Jenkinson 1974, 1977), and the seasonal pattern of seedling RGC in the nursery depends on climatic region and altitude of seed origin in the Cascade Range-Sierra Nevada and transverse-peninsular ranges (Jenkinson 1976, 1980). Tree growth rate increased with decrease in source ele- vation in early years in plantations at low, middle, and high elevations in the western Sierra Nevada, but in later years, performances of high-elevation sources at high elevation overtook those of low-elevation sources and neared those of mid-elevation sources. Wind and snow damage reduced the superiority of mid-an low-elevation sources. Wood specific gravity increased with decrease in source elevation in all",
