Field seeding and nursery practice. Although
Apache-plume has been successfully established via direct-
seeding in the fall or spring in the northern part of its range

way. Despite of their small size, the seeds must be covered
in order for seedlings to establish, but planting them too

season. For bareroot production, seeding into a firm seedbed
prior to the season of most dependable moisture is recom-
mended. When grown in the North, the seedlings are decidu-
ous and can be safely lifted and transplanted once they lose
their leaves. The stems are brittle and the roots often poorly
developed, necessitating careful handling. For container pro-
duction, direct-sowing without pretreatment is the usual
practice, though some workers prefer to chill or cold-stratify
the seeds for 30 days, either before or after planting, to
ensure rapid and complete germination (Link 1993). A well-
drained growing medium is required. Container-grown
plants tend to be evergreen and must be hardened off care-
fully to minimize transplant losses.
