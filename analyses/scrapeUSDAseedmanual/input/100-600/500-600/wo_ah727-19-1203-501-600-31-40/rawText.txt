late winter to early spring will result in seedlings that grow
quite vigorously, attaining heights of about 30 cm (12 in) by
fall (Judd 1930). If container production is desired, Farmer
and Chase (1977) recommend 8 to 16 weeks of stratifica-
tion, after which seeds are sown to a 5-mm (0.2-in) depth in
flats containing a medium of peat and perlite. Shoot emer-
gence occurs in about 2 weeks at day/night germination
temperatures of 27/21 °C. Seedlings should remain in flats
until they reach a height of 3 to 5 cm (1 to 2 in), when they
should be transplanted to 10-cm (4-in) pots containing a
medium of finely ground peat moss. Plants are maintained
in these pots under natural photoperiods for a period of 4 to

native ornamentals, Franklin tree prefers a moist, acidic soil
(pH 5.5 to 6.5) that must be well drained (Schneider 1988).

Extraction and storage of seeds. Samaras should be
but they must be completely dry for the process to be suc-
spread in shallow layers for complete drying, especially
cessful. Smaller seedlots, such as those used for research or
when collected early. Dried clusters may be broken apart by
testing, can be de-winged in laboratory blenders operated at
hand, by flailing sacks of clusters, or by running the clusters
low speeds about half-full of water. Seed yield data for

Stems and trash can then be removed by fanning or with air-

Pregermination treatments. Most species of ash
exhibit a complex dormancy that is due to both seedcoat and
internal factors. The seedcoat effect apparently is based on
restriction of moisture and oxygen uptake, and scarification
or removal of pericarp, seedcoats, or both will lead to quick
germination of several species of ash (Arrillaga and others
1992; Bonner 1974; Gendel and others 1977; Marshall
1981). Karrfalt (1992) reported that de-winging white ash
seeds with a brush machine led to quicker germination,
apparently because the brushes scarified the seedcoats.
Internal dormancy appears to be related to germination
inhibitors or their balance with germination promoters
(Kentzer 1966; McBride and Dickson 1972; Sondheimer
and others 1974; Stinemetz and Roberts 1984; Tinus 1982;
Tzou and others 1973). European and black ashes also have
immature embryos that must complete development during
after-ripening for good germination (Nikolaeva 1967;
Suszka and others 1996; Vanstone and LaCroix 1975; Walle
1987). This condition has led to the use of warm incubation
of imbibed seeds prior to cold stratification for overcoming
dormancy in these species. For European ash, Tylkowski
(1990, 1993) has recommended 16 weeks at 15 or 20 °C,
followed by 16 weeks at 3 °C. Seed moisture content should
be from 55 to 60% during this period, and a 1-hour re-soak
in water should be carried out weekly in the warm phase
and every 2 weeks in the cold phase. The warm phase can
be less than 16 weeks if periodic examinations of longitudi-
nal cuts of seeds show the embryo to have reached 80 to
90% of the seed length (Suszka and others 1996). In many
cases, the same warm/cold treatment approach has been ben-
eficial to green and white ashes from the northern portions
of their ranges (Bonner 1974; Cram 1984; Tinus 1982).
Cold stratification alone is usually sufficient for sources of
these 2 species from the southern portion of their ranges
(Bonner 1973, 1975). The degree of dormancy also seems
related to seed age: older stored seeds appear more dormant
than freshly collected ones (Bonner 1974; Tinus 1982).
Shamel ash does not require pretreatment for prompt germi-
nation (Francis 1990). Pretreatment recommendations for
dormant ashes are summarized in table 5. Germination is
epigeal (figure 4) and may occur the spring following seed-
fall, or seeds may lie dormant in the litter for several years
before germinating.
Germination tests. Official germination recommen-
dations for ashes call for either 56 days (ISTA 1993) or 28
days (AOSA 1993) with stratified seeds on blotter paper
with diurnally alternating temperatures of 30 °C in light and
20 °C in the dark. Prescriptions for individual species and
some representative results of tests with stratified seeds

genus, rapid viability tests by embryo excision or tetrazoli-
um staining are preferred over actual germination tests for
all except green ash (AOSA 1993; ISTA 1993). Staining
with indigo-carmine has been popular and successful with
European ash (Suszka and others 1996). Rapid testing with
x-rays is also possible, but relating the images to seed quali-
ty is reported to be difficult with white ash (Houston 1976).

Nursery practice. Ash seeds may be sown in the fall
without stratification, especially in the northern United
States. Seeds should be planted as soon as collected, prefer-
ably by mid-October (Eliason 1965). European ash is usual-
ly sown unstratified in August or September or stratified for
16 to 18 months and sown in March or April in England.
Fall-sown seeds of this species will germinate the following
spring, but yield is erratic (Aldhous 1972). Seeds treated
with warm incubation, followed by cold stratification, as
described earlier, can be stored non-dormant at -3 °C for up
to 8 weeks before sowing, or dried up to 8 to 10% moisture
at 20 °C and stored for up to 2 years before sowing (Suszka
under or near these conditions are given in table 6. Recent
and others 1996). Fall-sown beds should be mulched with
research in Italy with European and flowering ashes sug-
burlap or straw, and the mulch removed as soon as germina-
gests that alternating temperatures of 25 °C for 8 hours and
tion starts in the spring. For spring-sowing, stratified seeds
5 °C for 16 hours (both in the dark) are better than 30/20 °C
should always be used. Seeds of most species should be

Flowering and fruiting. The large, perfect, yellow to
copper-colored flowers appear on the plants from April
through June. They have a single perianth series that is fused
into a saucer shape, 5 stamens fused into a staminal column,
and a superior ovary. The flowers produce abundant nectar
and are pollinated mostly by large native bees (Boyd 1994).
Much of the seedcrop may be destroyed by insect larvae
prior to dispersal, at either the flower bud or the immature
fruit stage (Boyd and Serafini 1992). The large, bristly, 4- to
5-chambered capsules ripen from July to September and
split open at the tip. The numerous reddish brown to black
