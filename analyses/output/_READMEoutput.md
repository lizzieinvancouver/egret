## Files
* egretclean.csv -- cleaned EGRET data, see egretcleanREADME.md (created in cleaning/cleanAll.R)
* egretPhylogenyFull.tre -- Cleaned EGRET phylogeny tree based on the Smith & Brown tree. Species names that do not exist in the tree but have a synonym in WCVP that exists in the tree have been used to place the species on the tree. Species names with no synonym that could be found in the tree have been spliced in by genus.
* usdaPhylogenyFull.tre -- Cleaned USDA phylogeny tree based on the Smith & Brown tree. Species names that do not exist in the tree but have a synonym in WCVP that exists in the tree have been used to place the species on the tree. Species names with no synonym that could be found in the tree have been spliced in by genus.
* phylogeny.tre - should we delete this?
