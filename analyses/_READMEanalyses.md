## What's in this folder?

Lots of stuff, let me just point out:
* analyses/cleaning is supposed to be general cleaning of egret in a way we would share with everyone
* analyses/analyseSeedCues/cleaning is cleaning for the SeedCues project (addressing: what determines germination %?)
* analyses/analysesBudCues/cleaning is cleaning for the BudCues project (adressing: do trees have similar cues for leafout and germination?)

## Why are there so many columns in egretclean? WTF?

Lizzie is adding a egretcleanREADME.md file to output. Good luck.
