Tilia americana" -- Spaeth, 1932; Barton, 1934; Pitel & Wang, 1988              
"Tilia cordata" -- Barton, 1934               
"Tilia dasystyla" -- not in B2             
"Tilia japonica" -- Heit, 1969b             
"Tilia platyphyllos" -- Barton, 1934; Heit, 1969b; Baskin et al., unpubl.

NONE of these are in B2 .. Some are in Woody Plant Manual, but it does not have germination info tables other refs in B2 for this genera are: Tiwari & Chauhan, 2007 and Wang et al., 2009d and Nichols, 1934
"Rhododendron dauricum"
"Rhododendron mucronulatum"    
"Rhododendron prinophyllum"
"Rhododendron simsii"          

Syringa josikaea"  -- not in B2            
"Syringa reticulata" --- mentioned as "High tempera- tures caused a significant increase in the mechanical resis- tance of the endosperm in seeds of Syringa vulgaris (Junttila, 1973b)." But this is about embryo covering         
"Syringa villosa" -- not in B2
"Syringa vulgaris" -- Wang et al., 2009d


REFS:

Tilia: Woody plant manual not great and below sound not great, but ordered some 

Spaeth, J.N., 1932. Hastening germination of basswood seeds. J. For. 30, 925928. Journal of Forestry, Volume 30, Issue 8, December 1932, Pages 925â€“928, https://doi.org/10.1093/jof/30.8.925  -- ORDERED 

Barton, L.V., 1934. Dormancy in Tilia seeds. Contrib. Boyce Thompson Inst. 6, 6989. -- ORDERED 

Pitel, J.A., Wang, B.S.P., 1988. Improving germination of basswood (Tilia americana L.) seeds with gibberellic acid. Seed Sci. Technol. 16, 273280. -- seems not great so did not try to track down

Also looked at A PRACTICAL METHOD OF OVERCOMING
SEED DORMANCY IN TILIA AMERICANA L.' Which is chemical but mentions stratification

*Promising* (find on G Scholar): Seed germination of woody and shrubby
introduced species by Khudonogova -- mix of our species across genera

Heit, C.E., 1969b. Propagation from seed. Part 7: germinating six hardseeded groups. Amer. Nurseryman 125, 1012, 3741, 4445. -- ORDERED

Tiwari, O.N., Chauhan, U.K., 2007. Seed germination studies in Rhododendron maddenii Hook. f. and Rhododendron niveum Hook. F. Indian J. Plant Physiol. 12, 5056. -- ORDERED

Nichols, G.E., 1934. The influence of exposure to winter temperatures upon seed germination in various native American plants. Ecology. 15, 364373. -- JSTOR, have, need to review

Wang, J.-H., Du, G.-Z., Cui, X.-L., Zheng, X.-F., Qi, W., 2009d. Germination characteristics of 61 common woody species from the eastern Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of China and their life history corre- lates. Zhi. Sheng. Xue. 33, 171179. -- Have looked this up before it is in CHINESE.


PROPOSED methods:

(A) To maximize overlap with species in OSPREE we reviewed references for in Baskin & Baskin for the top XX genera, obtaining all possible and extracting data from any mentioning our species and meeting criteria for our ISI/Google Scholar Searches. 

(B) To maximize overlap with species in OSPREE we reviewed references for in Baskin & Baskin for all OSPREE species, and reviewed reference titles for ... err, not sure!
