Searching for refs for OSPREE species

See also https://github.com/lizzieinvancouver/egret/issues/13

Steps:
- Look up five references for specific genera (or all available if fewer) based on tables in Baskin and Baskin (likely on pages 715 for deciduous; 700-705 for some of the species)
- ISI search of your species and terms like "seed germination" and "seed dormancy" (optional task depending on outcome of above)
- ENTER your data using baskinsearches.xlsx BUT make a copy for you with your initials at the end.


Based on the number of species per genera:
	@FrederikBaumgarten: Prunus and Betula
	@lizzieinvancouver: Quercus and Viburnum
	@DeirdreLoughnan: Acer and Picea
	@dbuona: Ulmus and Populus
