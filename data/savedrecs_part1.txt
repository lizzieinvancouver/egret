AB Recently, a clover-breeding program has been launched using the genetic
   diversity of wild clover species (Trifoliumspp.) in order to release new
   clover germplasms in Iran. Seed dormancy was the major limitation for
   using these germplasms. To resolve this issue, 12 accessions ofT.
   campestreScherb.,T. diffusumEhrh.,T. echinatumM. Bieb.,T. hirtumAll.,
   andT. lappaceumL., wild species, together with cultivated species (T.
   resupinatumL.) which had been selected from previous studies were
   subjected in this research. Clover seeds were treated by two thermal (2
   and 21 degrees C) and two scarification treatments, in a factorial
   design. F-test indicated a significant difference (p < 0.00) for
   germination rate between scarified and non-scarified treatments.
   However, the cold treatment did not increase the seed germination rate
   in the non-scarified groups, even though the seeds were transferred from
   2 to 21 degrees C after 4 weeks of seeding. Whereas, the seed coat
   scarification had a high positive significant effect on seed germination
   rate. It means the seed dormancy was physical rather than physiological.
   Based on of Duncan's test and cluster analysis, the accessions were
   grouped into three classes in accordance with variation in seed
   hardness: i-accessions ofT. resupinatumwhich showed no seed coat
   hardness, ii- accessions ofT. campestrewith a slightly degree of seed
   hardness, and cluster iii- containing the accessions of four wild
   species with severe seed hardness. In addition, there was diversity in
   seed germination for different seed coat colors. Since brown seeds
   showed more water permeable coats, breeding for this color type leads to
   soft-coat seeds. Finally, it is proposed that the seed coat
   scarification is an essential process before sowing of wild clovers'
   seeds.

AB Enhancing the host resistance using biotic elicitors is one of the
   eco-friendly approaches developed for plant disease management. The
   Crude Oligosaccharides (CO) extracted from Colletotrichum capsici (Syd.)
   Butler & Bisby was evaluated for their efficiency to elicit resistance
   in chilli against anthracnose disease. Among the different
   concentrations tested, CO treatment at 2.5mg/ml concentration for 3h
   duration significantly enhanced seed germination (90.5%) and seedling
   vigor (986.7), compared to control which offered 78% of seed germination
   and 712.5 of seedling vigor. Application of CO at 2.5mg/ml concentration
   also reduced the disease severity with a highest anthracnose disease
   protection of 68% under greenhouse conditions and enhanced the
   vegetative growth parameters compared to control. The induction of
   resistance was evident with higher expression of primary defense
   responses like hypersensitive response, deposition of lignin, callose,
   hydrogen peroxide and phenol when compared to control plants. There was
   a one fold increase in defense enzyme activities phenylalanine ammonia
   lyase, peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, and lipoxygenase in crude
   oligosaccharide-treated inoculated seedlings when compared to
   susceptible inoculated seedlings which were similar to that of resistant
   inoculated seedlings where a maximum of 1.5-fold increase in enzyme
   activity was observed.

AB The aim of this research was to evaluate cataia (Drimys brasiliensis
   Miers. - Winteraceae) seed germination under different, temperatures,
   substrate and stratification times. Seeds were submitted to
   stratification method in green house, without controlled temperature,
   during 30, 60 and 90 days. Filter paper, sand, vermiculite and agar 1%
   were tested as substrates. Were compared constant temperatures of 17, 25
   and 30ºC under light, and alternate temperatures treatments of 20-30ºC,
   adopting 20ºC for 16 hours in absence of light and 30ºC for 8 hours
   exposed to light. IVG (Germination Speed Index) was obtained
   additionally as a vigor test, by counting normal seedlings everyday
   after sowing. Cataia seeds showed 7% of moisture content (wet basis) at
   the beginning of the experiment. After 30, 60 and 90 days of sand
   stratification, these seeds presented 11,3%, 27,7% and 46,2% of moisture
   content, respectively. Treatments with 30 and 60 days of sand
   stratification at 17ºC obtained the highest germination percentage, of
   67% and 52%, respectively. The highest percentage of germination was
   obtained after 30 days of sand stratification corresponding to 68% for
   substrates like agar, sand and filter paper, and 61% for vermiculite.
   For the treatment with 60 days of sand stratification, the highest
   germination percentages were 56%, 58% and 54% in agar, sand and filter
   paper, respectively, without statistic difference. The vigor seeds (IVG)
   were those that were sand stratified for 60 days and were transferred to
   agar, sand and filter paper to germinate, at 17ºC, presenting
   germination rate of 0,55, 0,61 and 0,65. It was possible to conclude
   that 60 days of sand stratification is an efficient method to broken
   cataia seed dormancy. The higher rate an percentage of germination were
   obtained at constant temperature of 17ºC with agar, sand and filter
   paper as substrates.
Y4 O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a germinação de sementes de cataia
   (Drimys brasiliensis) sob diferentes temperaturas e tempos de
   estratificação. As sementes foram submetidas ao método de estratificação
   em casa de vegetação, sem controle de temperatura, durante 30, 60 e 90
   dias. Foram testados os substratos papel de filtro, areia, vermiculita e
   ágar a 1% e as temperaturas constantes de 17ºC, 25ºC e 30ºC, na presença
   de luz contínua e temperatura alternada de 20-30ºC, sendo 20ºC por 16
   horas no escuro e 30ºC por 8 horas em presença de luz. O vigor foi
   avaliado por meio do índice de velocidade de germinação (I.V.G.). As
   sementes apresentaram grau de umidade inicial de 7% (base úmida). Após
   30, 60, 90 dias de estratificação o grau de umidade passou para 11,3%,
   27,7% e 46,2%, respectivamente. Os valores da porcentagem de germinação
   foram de 67% e 52% nos tratamentos com 30 e 60 dias de estratificação,
   respectivamente, obtidos na temperatura de 17ºC. Os valores de
   germinação obtidos com 30 dias de estratificação foram 68% para os
   substratos ágar, areia, e papel de filtro e 61% para o substrato
   vermiculita. No tratamento com 60 dias de estratificação, os valores de
   porcentagem de germinação foram 56%, 58% e 54% nos substratos ágar,
   areia e papel de filtro, respectivamente, não diferindo estatisticamente
   entre si. As sementes mais vigorosas foram as estratificadas durante 60
   dias e colocadas para germinar nos substratos ágar, areia e papel de
   filtro, na temperatura de 17ºC, onde foram obtidos os valores 0,55, 0,61
   e 0,65 para I.V.G., respectivamente. As sementes apresentam dormência
   por imaturidade embrionária e a estratificação em areia durante 60 dias
   é um método eficiente para superar a dormência das sementes de cataia.
   Os maiores valores de velocidade e percentagem de germinação em sementes
   de cataia são obtidos na temperatura constante de 17ºC com o uso dos
   substratos ágar, areia e papel de filtro.

   scarification, dehulling (removing the mesocarp and exocarp from the
   nut) and gibberellic acid (GA(3)) on seed germination and seedling
   development of two different Pistacia khinjuk genotypes (A and B) using
   as rootstock for pistachio cultivars. Seed dormancy-breaking treatments
   were shelled (control), shelled + GA(3), dehulled, dehulled + GA(3),
   sulphuric acid scarification and sulphuric acid scarification + GA(3)
   applications in the present experiment. The seeds of both genotypes were
   stratified at 4 degrees C for 50 days after the dormancy-breaking
   treatments. Stratified seeds were sown in the vials filled with peat in
   the greenhouse to determine the germination percentage. Plantlets were
   transplanted to plastic containers to determine the vegetative growth.
   The highest germination rate was obtained from sulphuric acid
   scarification in both P. khinjuk genotypes. In P. khinjuk-A seedlings,
   the highest stem growth was obtained from scarification and dehulled
   applications, whereas the poorest development was observed from dehulled
   + GA(3) application. The best growth in the P. khinjuk-B seedlings was
   obtained from scarification + GA(3) application. The effect of the
   dehulled application on the root development of P. khinjuk-A seedlings
   was better than the other applications; however the effect of
   dormancy-breaking applications on root development of P. khinjuk-B
   seedlings was found to unsteady. Scarification increased the number of
   leaves in both genotypes. As a result, dormancy-breaking applications
   have been found to be effective on seed germination and seedling growth
   of P. khinjuk. It was determined that GA(3) applications negatively
   affected both seed germination and root, stem and leaf growth of P.
   khinjuk-A.

   Gomphrena perennis. The objective of this research was to examine the
   effects of temperature, light, moist chilling, osmotic potential, dry
   storage and depth of seed burial on G. perennis germination and
   emergence. The optimum temperature for germination was around 1520
   degrees C. Seeds showed germination rates above 90% under 20/10 and
   25/15 degrees C temperature regimes. The minimum exposure to light
   needed to stimulate germination was 1 min. However, the light
   requirement was reduced after a long storage period. Furthermore,
   germination was high (>90%) in all moist-chilling treatments tested.
   Germination was highly sensitive to increasing osmotic stress. The
   highest germination percentage (94%) was achieved at 0 MPa, and
   decreasing osmotic potential from 0 to -0.3 MPa reduced germination to
   11%. The highest seedling emergence occurred for seeds placed from 0 to
   1 cm deep, and no seedlings emerged from a 5-cm burial depth. Gomphrena
   perennis has a suitable environment in a no-till soybean field, where
   seeds remaining on the surface have the required temperature, light and
   depth needed for germination.

   was compared with other priming agents: kinetin (0.5% w/v), KCl (2% w/v)
   and hydropriming, each for 18 hours in hybrid maize cv. Pioneer-6525.
   Non-primed seeds were used as the control. Priming with MLE was the most
   effective in improving germination rate and subsequent seedling;growth.
   This increased seedling performance was the result of reduced time to
   50% germination (T-50) and mean germination time (MGT), and higher final
   germination percentage (FGP), germination index (GI) and germination
   energy (GE). Similarly improved seedling growth following seed priming
   with MLE or kinetin was due to enhanced root and shoot lengths, the
   ratio of root:shoot length and maximum seedling fresh and dry weights
   compared with control seeds. Enhanced seedling maize performance by
   priming with MLE was attributed to improved chlorophyll content, amylase
   activity and total sugar contents under cool conditions.

AB Increased salinity is a severe problem to crop production while
   pre-sowing seed treatments can effectively induce salt tolerance in
   plants. The effect of different pre-sowing seed treatments
   (hydropriming, halopriming (50 mM CaCl2.2H(2)O), ascorbate priming (50
   mg L-1) and pre-sowing chilling treatment (-19 degrees C) on seed
   germination, vigor, antioxidants and total soluble protein content was
   investigated in two wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars Auqab-2000
   (salt tolerant) and MH-97 (salt sensitive) under saline (15 dS m(-1)) or
   non-saline (4 dS m(-1)) conditions. Of all the seed pretreatments,
   halopriming followed by hydropriming was the most effective in
   alleviating the adverse effect of salinity by improving germination and
   seedling growth of both cultivars. In addition, the effect of ascorbate
   priming was more pronounced in salt tolerant cultivar as revealed from
   curtailed mean germination time. improved seedling vigor and enhanced
   ascorbate contents and catalase (CAT) activity. Salinity significantly
   increased leaf protein content in both cultivars but the magnitude of
   increase in protein content was higher in Auquab-2000 as compared to
   that in MH-97. All pre-sowing seed treatments significantly enhanced
   superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in MH-97 while priming with
   CaCl2.2H(2)O and ascorbate were very effective in Auqab-2000 during
   stress conditions. The salt-tolerant cultivar Auqab-2000 had a better
   protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS) as shown by increased
   SOD and CAT activities under salt stress. In conclusion, halopriming and
   hydropriming successfully improved the seed performance in both
   cultivars whereas priming with ascorbate was only effective in salt
   tolerant cultivar under saline conditions. This benefit was attributed
   to early and synchronized germination, virgorous stand establishment,
   and decreased oxidative damage due to enhanced antioxidant system.

AB In an investigation of germination of seeds of species suitable for
   revegetation of subalpine meadows, it was found that stratification
   reduced germination time and decreased germination percentage in Festuca
   viridula. Seeds of Lupinus latifolius germinated readily without
   stratification. From trials with various methods for establishment of F.
   ovina var. duriscula, and controlled-environment studies, it was
   concluded that the duration of available soil moisture was the principal
   limiting factor for seed germination and that the microenvironment can
   be modified to increase the changes of successful germination.

   naturalistic sowing mixes. in vitro and the field. Many of these species
   have some form of endogenous dormancy and chilling increased germination
   in all species except for Polemonium reptans. Of the 18 species tested,
   12 species showed greatest germination after 60 and 90 days chilling.
   Highest germination under in vitro conditions was obtained in
   Dodecatheon meadia (96.67%) and Primula vulgaris (81.67%). Many
   understorey species germinated in the fridge at 4 degrees C when chilled
   for longer than 60 days. Sixty days chilling was the best compromise
   between breaking dormancy and preventing germination in the fridge. Mean
   species emergence in the field was significantly different (p<0.01) to
   that in vitro for most species. Species that germinated well in vitro
   also emerged well in the field however the degree of correspondence
   varied widely. The study suggests that simple, standardised tests that
   better predict field emergence of dormant species are required to
   improve the reliability of seed mixes containing these species.

AB The presence of dormancy in the seeds of Apiaceae plants is one of the
   important reasons that make the plant cultivation and domestication
   difficult. This research was conducted in the Seed Technology Laboratory
   of Shahed University. The factorial experiment was performed consisting
   of two levels of mechanical scarification (no-scarification and
   scarification) and three concentrations of gibberellin (0, 400 and 700
   ppm) in a completely randomized design with four replications. Results
   showed that the scarification treatment affected the considered traits
   except for the germination rate. In the mechanical scarification
   treatment, the normal seedling was not produced and therefore, the
   traits were related to the seedling without the scarification. Seed
   treatment in the absence of mechanical scarification and priming showed
   the highest germination rate, which is recommended for achieving the
   high germination. In addition, the gibberellin concentration of 400 ppm
   was one of the treatments that showed a relatively high germination
   rate. Consequently, keeping the seeds moist with distilled water at low
   temperatures is more effective in achieving higher germination rate than
   the conditions without scarification and priming. However, gibberellin
   at 400 ppm concentration was associated with increase in the length of
   radicle and stem, fresh and dry seedling weight, allometric coefficient,
   seedling vigor index, relative water content, photosynthetic pigment
   content, MDA content and catalase activity. In general, results showed
   that no-stratification and gibberellic acid (400 ppm) is the best
   treatment for breaking seeds of Kelussia odoratissima Mozaff.

AB In 2 clones of native A. arguta (AW-82-3 and AW-82-12), which bears
   edible fruits, seed germination increased cumulatively after up to 4
   weeks of chilling at 5°C without a further increase in germination
   thereafter. Within the range 20-30°, germination decreased with
   increasing temperature; this inhibition was partially or completely
   overcome by prolonged stratification or treatment with 10-500 p.p.m. GA.
   High GA (100 and 500 p.p.m.) and low kinetin (10 p.p.m.) treatment
   enhanced seed germination, the optimal levels differing between the
   clones used. Germination rate was improved by light; GA enhanced
   germination in the dark. Chilling, GA or kinetin treatments were
   ineffective in inducing germination of low density seeds (< 1.0 g/cm).

   to compare it with the behaviour of the native Korean Taraxacum spp. (T.
   platycarpum and T. hallaisanensis) in the wild. Seeds were chilled for
   10, 20, 30, and 60 days at 5°C, and were sown under light and dark
   conditions. The germination percentage of non-chilled T. platycarpum
   seeds was 28% under light, and that of 60-day chilled seed was 90% under
   light. Germination energy and average length of germination time were
   the highest under light and 30-day chilling conditions. In T.
   hallaisanensis the germination percentage was also high under light and
   30-day chilling conditions. However, germination of T. officinale was
   not influenced by chilling treatment, but was high under the light
   conditions. It is suggested that T. officinale has an advantage in
   germination over native Taraxacum spp. which always required chilling
   treatment.

   Pinus sylvestris L. seeds was studied at four different germination
   temperatures (10, 13, 16, and 20 C) using both moist-chilled and
   unchilled seeds. Germination of B. pendula seeds was prevented by low
   R/FR. In B. pendula the relationship between germination probability and
   R/FR (log(2)) at different temperatures was successfully quantified
   using parallel logistic curves. The relationship between mean
   germination time (log(10)) and R/FR (log(2)) was linear. Moist chilling
   for 3 weeks reduced but did not eliminate the R/FR response in B.
   pendula. In Picea abies seeds, low R/FR prevented germination at 10 C
   but not at 13-20 C. Pinus sylvestris seeds did not respond to low R/FR
   at the studied temperatures. It appears that B. pendula has evolved a
   light-sensing mechanism that prevents seed germination in shaded
   conditions. This mechanism could operate more effectively in autumn than
   in spring after natural moist chilling during overwintering in soil.
   Picea abies seeds have also evolved a light-sensing mechanism that
   regulates germination in cool conditions.

AB Cacti are characteristic plants in arid ecosystems, where they play an
   important ecological role. Many species are threatened because of
   habitat destruction and collection for commercial purposes. In South
   America, Argentina is one of the countries with the greatest cacti
   richness and endemisms. However, cacti have been scarcely studied,
   especially the southernmost species. Since the study of cacti's
   reproductive biology would help to improve their conservation status, we
   studied basic physiological aspects of the germination of two endemic
   species of Argentina and Chile, Maihuenia patagonica (Phil.) Britton &
   Rose and Maihueniopsis darwinii (Hensl.) F. Ritter var. hickenii
   (Britton & Rose) R. Kiesling. Germination percentage (G), mean
   germination time (TMG) and time until germination (IG) of control seeds
   and seeds subjected to three pre-germinative treatments were evaluated.
   Treatments were cold moist stratification for 40 days, mechanical
   scarification with sand and sandpaper, and mechanical scarification with
   a scalpel. Laboratory assays were performed at 20/10 degrees C and 12 h
   light/12 h dark regime during 60 days. In M patagonica germination in
   the stratification treatment did not differ from the control, but was
   higher in the scarification with scalpel. In M darwinii var. hickenii
   germination only differed between the stratification and the
   scarification with scalpel. TMG and IG were higher in the stratification
   treatment than in the control for M patagonica, whereas scarification
   treatments did not differ from the control. As for M darwinii var.
   hickenii no differences were detected for TMG, but the IG was lower in
   the stratification than in the control. Probably both species presents
   some kind of dormancy, since germination percentages were low (M
   patagonica between 8-27 % and M darwinii var. hickenii between 17-26 %)
   but seeds presented high viability. Presence of physical dormancy is
   discarded because control seeds of both species germinated and the
   presence of non deep physiological dormancy is proposed. The latter was
   partially overcome by mechanical scarification in M patagonica. These
   results are a new contribution to the study of cacti in South America
   and could help to develop in situ conservation strategies through the
   restoration of degraded areas.

AB Mature seeds of H. salicifolia, collected from five provenances (i.e.
   Hanuman Chatti, Helang, Lata, Rambara and Janggal Chatti) in west
   Himalaya, India, were treated with stratification (at 4 degrees C for
   15, 30 and 60 days) and in different concentrations of GA(3) (5, 10, 20
   mM), KNO3 (50, 100, 200 mM) and Thiourea (50, 100, 200 mM) Solution to
   determine the variations in seed germination. Results reveal that the
   germination rates of seeds from different provenances under different
   pre-sowing treatments are significantly increased compared to those in
   control (24% 30%). The seeds treated with Thiourea (100 mM) have highest
   germination rate (76%-83% for different seed sources), followed by those
   (63% 71% for different seed sources) pretreated with stratification (4
   degrees C, 30 days). GA(3) treatment significantly shortens the mean
   germination time (MGT) and improves seed germination percentage.
   Considering the practical applicability and cost effectiveness, thiourea
   (100 mM) and stratification (at 4 degrees C) treatments for seed
   germination are recommended for mass multiplication through seeds of H.
   salicifolia in village/forest nurseries of the west Himalaya, India.

AB Seeds of the mahaleb cherry, Prunus mahaleb L., used as a rootstock in
   cherry production, germinate and emerge poorly due to seed dormancy. A
   greenhouse experiment was done to determine the effects of several
   treatments to overcome this dormancy, i.e. prolonged (30, 60 and 90
   days) stratification followed by hot water treatment at 90 degrees C
   (for 0, 10, 20 and 30 minutes) or sulfuric acid scarification (0, 10, 20
   and 30 minutes) or gibberellic acid, GA(3) (0, 500, 1000 and 2000 ppm).
   The results showed that stratification for 60 days or more increased
   germination percentage and decreased mean germination time.
   Scarification with either hot water or sulfuric acid only improved
   germination percentage and speed if followed by 60 days of
   stratification. Treating the seeds with GA(3) resulted in a
   significantly higher germination rate. The highest germination
   percentages were attained by treating seeds which had been stratified
   for 60 and 90 day-periods with GA(3) at 1000 ppm. It is recommended that
   GA(3) should be used in addition to cold stratification for improving
   germination percentage and speed of mahaleb cherry seeds.

AB Understanding how temperature and other environmental cues influence
   germination traits can aid in the conservation and management of rare
   plant species. We examined the germination niche of the narrow endemic
   Solidago albopilosa, a perennial herb restricted to sandstone rockhouses
   in the southeastern United States. We experimentally subjected seeds to
   varying lengths of cold stratification, incubation temperatures,
   photoperiods, and seasonal temperature cycles that simulated current
   ambient temperatures and a climate warming scenario. Seeds exhibited
   conditional physiological dormancy and germinated at greater proportions
   following chilling than when fresh in all temperatures and light regimes
   tested. In seasonal temperature cycles that simulate those after seed
   dispersal in late autumn, seeds began germinating Mier 9 wk in
   late-winter temperatures (February), with peak germination occurring in
   early spring (March). Germination timing shifted 1 wk earlier in the
   spring with climate warming, but germination proportions did not differ
   among treatments. Buried seeds did not persist to the second germination
   season (spring), suggesting minimal carryover among years. Seed
   viability declined in the smallest (< 50 stems) populations but varied
   less among sites with different levels of human disturbance. A
   germination niche defined by conditional physiological dormancy, a
   minimal chilling requirement, dark germination, seasonal germination
   cueing, and low persistence in the soil is consistent with the
   expectation of a perennial herb from a stable habitat, but diverges in
   some aspects from seed traits found in Solidago species of grasslands
   and open habitats. These results suggest that dormancy or germination do
   not limit seed regeneration in most natural populations nor contribute
   to S. albopilosas rarity.

AB Partial drying of non-dormant seeds had little effect on germination
   behavior compared with undried controls. In contrast, partial drying
   resulted in a marked increase in the germination response of freshly
   harvested (dormant) seeds of Z. palustris. Partial drying also resulted
   in a 100-fold reduction in the concentration of gibberellins (GA-4+7)
   required for maximum germination. Although the concentration range of
   applied abscisic acid (ABA) that permitted germination was unaltered,
   partial drying increased the final germination percentage at all
   concentrations tested. The concentration of ABA above which germination
   was reduced in freshly harvested (dormant) seeds of Z. palustris was
   3.16 times 10-7 M compared with 10-4 M in fresh (non-dormant) seeds of
   P. coarctata. Changes in the germination response of Z. palustris seeds
   to applied growth regulators, following partial drying or cold
   stratification might be explained by similar changes in hormonal status.

AB The effect of temperature on germination rate of Rumex dentatus adapted
   to the arid environment of Saudi Arabia was studied. Germination
   percentage was low (only 20% after 7 days in the dark at laboratory
   temperature). Cold stratification and gibberellic acid treatment
   significantly stimulated seed germination. Stratified seeds did not
   germinate at 35 or 45 degrees C, or at alternating temperatures 28/14
   and 36/10 degrees C. Germination was significantly promoted at 15, 18/8
   and 21/10 degrees C, and transferring the ungerminated seeds at 25
   degrees C and 35 degrees C to 15 degrees C promoted germination. The
   metabolism of germinated cotyledons was studied at various stages of
   germination up to 6 days. The analysis of protein by SDS-PAGE showed the
   appearance of new major and minor bands during germination and only a
   few components were hydrolysed. Starch content decreased slowly in the
   first 3 days followed by a period of rapid decline. Amylase activity
   appeared from the first day and the electrophoretic patterns underwent
   changes during germination. (C) 1996 Academic Press Limited

AB Application of the nanopriming technique to alleviate seed dormancy has
   shown promising results in various agricultural crop species. However,
   there is a dearth of knowledge regarding its potential use in native
   peatland boreal forest species to alleviate seed dormancy and improve
   their propagation or vigor for forest reclamation activities. Herein, we
   demonstrate the use of nanopriming with carbon nanotubes (CNT) to
   alleviate seed dormancy, improved seed germination, and seedling vigor
   in two boreal peatland species. Bog birch (Betula pumila L.) and
   Labrador tea (Rhododendron groenlandicum L.) seeds with embryo or seed
   coat dormancy were nanoprimed with either 20 or 40 mu g/mL CNT, cold
   stratified at 2-4 degrees C for 15 days, and allowed to germinate at
   room temperature. The emerged seedlings' lipidome was assessed to
   decipher the role of lipid metabolism in alleviating seed dormancy. We
   observed significant (p < 0.05) improvement in seedling germination and
   seedling vigor in seeds primed with multiwalled carbon nanotubes
   functionalized with carboxylic acids. Phosphatidylcholine (PC
   18:1/18:3), phosphatidylglycerol (PG 16:1/18:3), and
   lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC 18:3) molecular species (C18:3 enriched)
   were observed to be highly correlated with the increased seed
   germination percentages and the enhanced seedling vigor.
   Mechanistically, it appears that carbon nanoprimed seeds following
   stratification are effective in mediating seed dormancy by remodeling
   the seed membrane lipids (C18:3 enriched PC, PG, and LPC) in both
   peatland boreal forest species. The study results demonstrate that
   nanopriming may provide a solution to resolve seed dormancy issues by
   enhancing seed germination, propagation, and seedling vigor in
   non-resource boreal forest species ideally suited for forest reclamation
   following anthropogenic disturbances.

AB Nanopriming has been shown to significantly improve seed germination and
   seedling vigor in several agricultural crops. However, this approach has
   not been applied to native upland boreal forest species with complex
   seed dormancy to improve propagation. Herein, we demonstrate the
   effectiveness of carbon nanoparticles functionalized with carboxylic
   acids in resolving seed dormancy and improved the propagation of two
   native upland boreal forest species. Seed priming with carbon
   nanoparticles functionalized with carboxylic acids followed by
   stratification were observed to be the most effective in improving
   germination to 90% in green alder (Alnus viridis L.) compared to 60% in
   the control. Conversely, a combination of carbon nanoparticles (CNPs),
   especially multiwall carbon nanoparticles functionalized with carboxylic
   acid (MWCNT-COOH), cold stratification, mechanical scarification and
   hormonal priming (gibberellic acid) was effective for buffaloberry seeds
   (Shepherdia canadensis L.). Both concentrations (20 mu g and 40 mu g) of
   MWCNT-COOH had a higher percent germination (90%) compared to all other
   treatments. Furthermore, we observed the improvement in germination,
   seedling vigor and resolution of both embryo and seed coat dormancy in
   upland boreal forest species appears to be associated with the
   remodeling of C18:3 enriched fatty acids in the following seed membrane
   lipid molecular species: PC18:1/18:3, PG16:1/18:3, PE18:3/18:2, and
   digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG18:3/18:3). These findings suggest that
   nanopriming may be a useful approach to resolve seed dormancy issues and
   improve the seed germination in non-resource upland boreal forest
   species ideally suited for forest reclamation following resource mining.

AB In order to study the seed germination behavior and dormancy breaking
   methods of three weed species (i.e., Chenopodium album, Convolvulus
   arvensis and Setariaviridis) of pistachio orchards in Rafsanjan, Iran,
   three separate factorial experiments (with 2 factors) were conducted
   based on a completely randomized design with four replications, at the
   Faculty of Agriculture, Vali-E-Asr University of Rafsanjan, Iran, in
   2014. Weed seeds were collected from five different regions of
   Rafsanjan, such as Markazi, Anar, Koshkoiyeh, Kabotarkhan and Nogh.
   Dormancy breaking treatments for Chenopodium album involved distilled
   water (control), KNO3 (at 500 and 1000 ppm), chemical scarification by
   sulfuric acid (for 5 and 10 min), and cold stratification (for 1, 3 and
   5 weeks). Treatments for Convolvulus arvensis involved distilled water
   (control), scarification by sandpaper, chemical scarification by
   sulfuric acid (20 and 30 min), and boiling water (for 15 and 30 min).
   Treatments for Setaria viridis involved distilled water (control),
   gibbereillic acid (250, 500 and 1000 ppm), KNO3 (500 and 1000 ppm), and
   cold stratification (for 1, 3 and 5 weeks). The results showed that seed
   germination percentage (SGP) and mean germination time (MGT) of three
   weed species were significantly different among weed populations and
   dormancy breaking methods. For Chenopodium album, cold stratification of
   5 weeks resulted in highest SGP (97%) in Nogh population. For
   Convolvulus arvensis and Setaria viridis, the highest SGP was obtained
   after scarification by sandpaper (98% in Kabotarkhan population), and
   using 1000 ppm gibbereillic acid (60% in Kabotarkhan population),
   respectively. In addition, increasing the weight of 1000 seeds in the
   three weed species in question increased SGP.

AB Advances in seed biology include progress in understanding the
   ecological significance of seed dormancy mechanisms. This knowledge is
   being used to make more accurate predictions of germination timing in
   the field. For several wild species whose seedlings establish in spring,
   seed populations show relevant variation that can be correlated with
   habitat conditions. Populations from severe winter sites, where the
   major risk to seedlings is frost, tend to have long chilling
   requirements or to germinate very slowly at low temperatures.
   Populations from warmer sites, where the major risk is drought, are
   non-dormant and germinate Very rapidly under these same conditions. Seed
   populations from intermediate sites exhibit variation in dormancy
   levels, both among and within plants, which spreads germination across a
   considerable time period. For grasses that undergo dry after-ripening,
   seed dormancy loss can be successfully modelled using hydrothermal time.
   Dormancy loss for a seed population is associated with a progressive
   downward shift in the mean base water potential, i.e., the water
   potential below which half of the seeds will not germinate. Other
   parameters (hydrothermal time requirement, base temperature and standard
   deviation of base water potentials) tend to be constant through time.
   Simulation models for predicting dormancy loss in the field can be
   created by combining measurements of seed zone temperatures with
   equations that describe changes in mean base water potential as a
   function of temperature. Successful validation of these and other models
   demonstrates that equations based on laboratory data can be used to
   predict dormancy loss under widely fluctuating field conditions. Future
   progress may allow prediction of germination timing based on knowledge
   of intrinsic dormancy characteristics of a seed population and long-term
   weather patterns in the field.

AB Germination of Quercus libani acorns with pericarps removed or intact
   were measured after various periods of stratification. Stratification in
   moist sand at 4°C for 8 weeks significantly increased germination
   percentage and rate of acorns with intact pericarps. Additional
   significant increases in germination occurred after 12 and 16 weeks of
   stratification in all three provenances. Removal of the pericarp in one
   provenance slightly increased germination of freshly collected acorns,
   while stratification for 4 to 12 weeks significantly increased
   germination percentage and rate of naked seeds. When averaged over all
   stratification times, germination rate and percentage were higher for
   seeds with pericarps removed than for acorns with pericarps intact.
   Germination percentage, GV and PV were the highest in Erzincan after 12
   and 16 weeks of stratification, which recorded medium seed weight, and
   were the least in Hakkari provenance, which recorded the highest seed
   weight. This study shows that stratification has a significant effect on
   Q. libani germination above and beyond that of pericarp removal and no
   significant correlation could be found between seed weight and
   germination characteristics. Dormancy of Q. libani appears to be
   influenced by factors associated with the pericarp and by internal
   blocks within the embryo.

AB Linden trees (Tilia spp.) are ornamental plants used in parks, gardens,

   dormancy breakage and seed germination improvement in mature and
   immature seeds of T. rubra subsp. caucasica f. angulata Rupr. collected
   from middle altitude (500 m) and high altitude (1500 m) of Hyrcanian
   forests, north of Iran. In 1st experiment, mature and immature seeds
   with pericarp were followed by 1) cold stratification (CS) without
   pretreatment, 2) imbibed with 30% NaOH + CS. Also, the mature and
   immature seeds without pericarp were imbibided in 1) Gibberelic acid
   (GA(3)) + CS, 2) kinetin (KN) + CS. The highest seed germination
   belonged to mature seeds without pericarp imbibed with GA3 or KN as well
   as to immature seeds with pericarp, cold stratified. The highest
   germination speed (%) allocated to immature seeds with pericarp, cold
   stratified, and the maximum mean germination time belonged to mature
   seeds without pericarp, imbibed with GA(3). In 2nd experiment,
   treatments were used the same as in the 1st experiment. The highest
   germination (%) allocated to seeds without pericarp of high altitude,
   treated respectively with GA3 + CS, and KN + CS. The highest germination
   speed (%) belonged to seeds with pericarp collected from middle
   altitude, treated respectively with CS and imbibed with GA(3)+ CS. The
   greatest mean germination time allocated to seeds without pericarp of
   high altitude, treated respectively with CS and imbibed with KA + CS.
   Generally, in the case of access only to seeds originating from middle
   altitude, it is better to expose immature seeds with pericarp to CS. If
   seeds of both middle and high altitudes are sufficient, it is advisable
   to imbibe immature, seeds without pericarp of high altitude with GA3 or
   KN followed by CS.

AB The germination of Ferula ovina seeds faces certain problems. The
   present research was designed to study the promotion of the germination
   of Ferula ovina seeds by moist-chilling and GA3 applications. The
   results showed that Ferula ovina seeds display an endogenous dormancy
   that can be released by moist-chilling treatment for a certain period.
   In this respect, the best treatment was moist-chilling for 6 weeks at
   51°C or for 4 weeks of moist-chilling followed by soaking in 500 ppm GA3
   solution for 24 h. These treatments significantly increased germination
   percentage and decreased time to 50% germination (T50) compared to
   control. Also, the characteristics of the obtained seedlings were much
   better than those of control. Moreover, the 6-week moist-chilled seeds
   contained the highest soluble protein concentration. The combination
   between GA3 and moist-chilling treatments produced different effects on
   seed germination, soluble protein depending on the length of the
   moist-chilling period. GA3 application on un-chilled seeds improves the

   of the tested seeds was negative (r=0.88, p<0.05) while, the

   correlated with the germination percentage. It was concluded that
   treatment of moist-chilling for 6 weeks or 4 weeks followed by 500 ppm

AB Two factorial experiments were conducted in Chaharmahal, Iran. The first
   experiment was performed with 6 replications to evaluate the effects of
   seed age, light and cold duration factors on seed germination
   percentage, and in the second experiment, the effect of cold duration
   and seed age on T50Ferula ovina seed was investigated. Results showed
   that one-year storage reduced seed germination percentage, but this
   reduction was not statistically significant. One-year-old seeds compared
   to freshly harvested seeds showed higher T50, which indicate the
   reduction of seed vigour and germination velocity. Data analysis showed
   that light effects was significant at 1% level. The germination rate in
   light was 45.6% higher than in darkness. Therefore, Ferula seeds were
   positive photoblastic and their germination depended on light. Also,
   moist chilling had significant influence on Ferula seed germination.
   Moist prechilling for 7-9 weeks was the best treatment for dormancy
   breaking of Ferula seeds. This improved seed vigour and enhanced the
   rate of germination but it could not replace the light effect. In either
   situation, light was required during the germination test for optimum
   results.

AB Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of
   gongzhulingmycin on rice seedling growth, cold tolerance genes
   expression and defense enzyme activities based on chilling stress
   exposure, and to elucidate the change in cold tolerance induced by
   gongzhulingmycin at the breeding stage of rice. Method: Rice variety
   'Jijing88' was used as the experimental material, the seed germination
   and seedling growth were investigated under different temperatures and
   the critical temperature of seed germination was calculated after seed
   priming by gongzhulingmycin. The solid fermentation product of
   gongzhulingmycin was powdered and added into the rice seedling substrate
   before sowing. Taking 'Jijing88' as the experimental material, the rice
   seedlings were subjected to cold stress treatment in simulated cold
   environment in late spring at the needle appearance stage of rice.
   Gradually warmed up and sampled continuously within 1-8 d after
   treatment and sampled every 7 days when plant temperature raised to
   28°C. Taking 'Jihong 6' as the experimental material, the rice seedlings
   were raised in the greenhouse and sampled when the seedlings grew to one
   leaf at a time. The expression of 4 cold tolerance genes (OsNAC6,
   OsSADMC, OsETR4 and OsZFP151) under the simulated cold environment in
   late spring and greenhouse seedling environment was analyzed by
   real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The changes of defense enzyme
   activities such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT),
   phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), polyphenol oxidase (PPO) in
   greenhouse seedlings before transplanting were detected. Result: The
   gongzhulingmycin could improve seed germination rate and germination
   index, shorten mean germination time, and its promoting effect on
   seedling growth was gradually obvious with the decrease of temperature.
   G-500x showed the best performance, which reduced the critical
   temperature of rice seed germination by 4.09%, and the subsequent
   experimental study was carried out based on this concentration. At the
   condition of low temperature simulation of the late spring cold, the
   application of gongzhulingmycin significantly increased the expression
   of OsNAC6, OsSADMC, OsETR4, and rapid response could be achieved to cope
   with low temperature stress by accelerating the response speed. The
   control mainly regulated the response speed and expression of OsZFP151
   to cope with low temperature stress, but the expression of OsZFP151 was
   also increased after gongzhulingmycin application compared to the
   control. After the rice seedlings were subjected to low temperature
   stress at the needle appearance stage of rice, the expression peaks of
   OsNAC6, OsSADMC and OsETR4 in the seedlings treated with
   gongzhulingmycin appeared 1-2 d earlier than that in the control, and
   were increased by 38.57%, 74.66% and 130.61%, respectively, compared
   with the control. The maximum expression of OsZFP151 was 2 d later than
   that of the control, but the maximum expression was 34.91% higher than
   that of the control. The optimum added weight of the solid fermentation
   productive powder of gongzhulingmycin was 8 g.m-2 in rice seedling
   substrate in the greenhouse seedling raising. When the seedlings grew to
   one leaf at a time after the addition of gongzhulingmycin, the
   expression levels of OsNAC6, OsSADMC, OsETR4 and OsZFP151 in the leaves
   were higher than those in the control group. The expression of OsNAC6,
   OsSADMC and OsETR4 was significantly increased. When the added weight
   was 8 g.m-2, the expression level of OsNAC6 was the highest (261.20).
   When the added weight was 5 g.m-2, the expression level of OsSADMC was
   the highest, which was increased by 126.30% than that of the control.
   When the added weight was 8 g.m-2, the expression level of OsETR4 was
   the highest, which was increased by 359.81% than that of the control.
   Gongzhulingmycin could increase the defense enzyme activities of rice
   seedlings at the four-leaf stage before transplanting. The activities of
   SOD, POD, PPO and PAL were all increased, especially the SOD and PPO
   activities increased by 57.18% and 28.53%, respectively. Conclusion:
   Proper application of gongzhulingmycin before sowing can decrease the
   critical temperature of germination, promote the growth of seedlings,
   significantly improve the seedling quality, increase the expression
   levels of cold tolerance genes, improve the response speed to low
   temperature stress and raise defense enzyme activities to stimulate the
   cold tolerance in rice seedlings.

   at 10, 15, and 20% for 3, 6, 9 and 12 h. Seeds were also hydroprimed for
   3, 6, 9 and 12 h, and nonprimed seeds were used as control. The result
   revealed that liquid Azospirillum 10% biopriming for 9 h or liquid
   phosphobacteria 15% biopriming for 9 h were found to be the best seed
   biopriming treatment for chilli seeds to enhance the germination rate,
   total germination percentage, seedling growth and vigor.

AB Perennial medicinal and aromatic plants (MAPs) may represent
   interesting, environmentally friendly crops for the Mediterranean
   environments. Among MAPs, Passiflora incarnata L. (maypop) represents a
   very promising crop for its wide adaptability to diverse climatic
   conditions, low input requirements, and high added-value due to its
   unique medicinal properties. The main problem in P. incarnata
   large-scale cultivation is the poor seed quality with erratic and low
   seed germination, due to its apparent pronounced seed dormancy.
   Therefore, the aim of this work was to investigate different chemical
   and physical treatments for overpassing seed dormancy and enhancing seed
   germination rates of P. incarnata. The effects of (i) different
   pre-germination treatments (pre-chilling, gibberellic acid-GA(3),
   leaching, scarification, non-treated control), (ii) light or darkness
   exposure, and (iii) temperature conditions (25, 30, and 35 & DEG;C
   constant and 20-30 & DEG;C alternating temperatures) have been examined
   in seed germination percentage and mean germination time of three P.
   incarnata accessions (F2016, FF2016, and A2016) grown in field
   conditions in Central Italy. Data showed that the pre-germination
   treatments generally stimulated faster germination compared to the
   control, with the best results obtained in the dark and with high
   temperatures. These findings are useful for the choice of the most
   suitable seed pre-germination treatment that can facilitate stable, high
   and agronomically acceptable germination rates in P. incarnata.</p>

AB In vitro embryo culturing has arisen as a powerful tool for embryo
   germination of low-viability seeds. This tool has been used to germinate
   seeds of early-maturing or hybrid Prunus species. 'Myrobalan' (Prunus
   cerasifera Ehrh.) is a widely used rootstock for plum and apricot
   cultivars and its interspecific hybrids have a clear potential for
   breeding purposes. However, early seed abortion is often a problem in
   interspecific crosses because no protocol has been established yet for
   'Myrobalan' seeds. In this work, we developed a procedure for in vitro
   germination of embryos of different sizes. Various factors affecting
   embryo germination such as the culture media, the presence of
   cotyledons, the stratification temperature, and the embryo size were
   tested in three different 'Myrobalan' clones. The developed protocol
   includes the use of full embryos that were stratified at 4 degrees C and
   cultured in C2d culture medium. The germination rate was strongly
   affected by the embryo size and reached 90% germination with
   intermediate- to large-sized embryos (6.5 to 10 mm). However, smaller
   embryos could also be germinated, and up to 30% germination was achieved
   with 0.5- to 2-mm long embryos. The results obtained here provide a
   protocol for in vitro germination of 'Myrobalan' embryos that will
   likely be helpful in breeding programs.

   indicated that the chemical scarification treatments and removal
   endocarp followed by an adequate stratification period can increase seed

   result for cv. Shengeh and cv. Zard observed following Cold
   stratification treatments for 31 days (85.55% and 84.44 respectively).
   The highest germination percentage of cv. Koroneiki obtained after 97%
   sulfuric acid solution treatments for 6 h (49.67%). Treating seeds of
   this cultivar by 97% sulfuric acid for longer period resulted in damage
   to embryo and no seedlings emerged after these treatments. The best
   result for cv. Shengeh observed following 97% sulfuric acid treatment
   for 9 h (42.34%) cv. Zard observed following 97% sulfuric acid treatment
   for 6 h (40.23%). The least germination rate and percentage was observed
   in control treatments. Growth of olive seedlings also increased by
   scarification, removal endocarp Cold stratification treatments
   significantly. Results suggested that removal endocarp and chemical

AB In order to evaluate different methods of seed dormancy breaking for
   Chinese lantern (Physalis alkekengi L.), two experiments were conducted
   at laboratory and greenhouse conditions. The laboratory treatments were
   22 different physical and chemical methods such as washing,
   stratification, scarification (sandy paper), sulfuric acid, gibberellic
   acid, potassium nitrate and the combination of both physical and
   chemical treatments. Eight of the best breaking seed dormancy treatments
   at the laboratory study were assessed at the greenhouse study. The
   results of the first experiment showed that all the treatments had
   significant effects on the measured traits. The highest germination
   percentage was shown in the combinational treatments (washing +
   gibberellic acid, sulfuric acid + potassium nitrate, scarification +
   gibberellic acid and scarification + potassium nitrate). These
   treatments led to 100% germination. The minimum mean germination time
   (MGT) was found in the washing + gibberellic acid (3.89 days), washing +
   potassium nitrate (4.42 days) and stratification + gibberellic acid
   (4.79 days) treatments. Sulfuric acid + potassium nitrate, washing +
   gibberellic acid, washing + potassium nitrate and stratification +
   potassium nitrate led to the highest seed vigor. The results of the
   second experiment revealed that the best treatments in terms of
   emergence percentage (EP) in the greenhouse were sulfuric acid +
   potassium nitrate (92%) and sulfuric acid + gibberellic acid (89%).
   Also, the minimum mean emergence time (MET) was obtained in washing +
   gibberellic acid (10 days). The highest seed vigor was found in washing
   + potassium nitrate and sulfuric acid + gibberellic acid. Totally,
   washing + gibberellic acid, washing + potassium nitrate, sulfuric acid +
   gibberellic acid and sulfuric acid + potassium nitrate were the best
   treatments to break Chinese lantern seed dormancy regarding germination
   percentage, MET and seed vigor.

   distilled water, 150 mol . m(-3) NaCl, or polyethylene glycol (PEG-8000,
   - 0.672 MPa), or by subjecting the seeds to chilling (5 degreesC) or
   heating (60 degreesC) for two days. Germination of both treated and
   non-treated seeds of both the cultivars was assessed for 8 days in
   Hoagland solution amended with 0 or 150 mol . m(-3) NaCl. Chilling, and
   to a lesser extent, PEG, increased the final germination percentage but
   not the germination rate of both the cultivars under both saline and
   non-saline conditions. Chilling alleviated the adverse effect of salt
   stress on IC- 8206 in terms of fresh and dry weights of shoots and roots
   following 42 d in sand culture that received 150 mol NaCl . m(-3).
   Chilling also reduced Cl- accumulation and, to a lesser extent, that of
   Na+, and enhanced K+ and Ca2+ accumulation in the shoots and roots of
   both cultivars under both saline and non-saline substrates. The reverse
   was true in plants raised from seeds treated with NaCl or PEG.

AB Kelussia odoratissima (Apiaceae) is an endangered medicinal plant
   indigenous to Iran. Seeds of this plant have a long-term dormancy. This
   study aimed at obtaining in vitro method to reduce microbial
   contamination, overcome seed dormancy and to disclose the type of
   classification system of seed dormancy. After using completely
   randomized design and Duncan's Multiple Range Test, the significance of
   between individual group's means was assessed. Results revealed that
   only one gram negative bacterium strain, Klebsiella sp., was isolated
   from the contaminated culture. Applying 500 mg/l copper sulphate for 6
   min during seed sterilization, the contamination was eradicated. During
   cold stratification, to estimate the effect of exogenous application of
   cytikinin hormones, N6-furfurylaninopurine (Kin) and 6-benzylaminopurine
   (BAP) alone or in combination with each other, pre-soaking treatment
   with tioureae as a nitrogen compound and seed osmopriming with
   polyethylene glycole (PEG 6000), alone or in combination with BAP, the
   highest final seed germination (92.5%) was obtained on medium containing
   1 mg/l BAP combined with 1 mg/l Kin. The lowest mean germination time
   (45.81 days) was also obtained on medium containing 0.25 mg/l BAP. Since
   using tiourea was simple and economical, with 80% final seed germination
   (using 0.2% thiourea) this can be an excellent way to promote seed
   germination of this plant. Considering the efficacy of treatments and
   growing of zygotic embryo without cold temperature exposure, seed
   dormancy mechanism identified as non-deep physiological dormancy and
   particularly chemical dormancy classification.

AB Cutleaf geranium is a weed infesting crop fields in various parts of the
   world. The present study was conducted to determine the cardinal
   temperatures of germination for its seeds to have a better understanding
   about temperature needs of this species. Since the seeds were dormant
   after being harvested, they underwent different dormancy breaking
   methods. Then, cardinal temperatures were estimated. Among dormancy
   breaking methods including constant and alternating temperatures,
   gibberellic acid, H2SO4 and gibberellic acid+ H2SO4 treatments,
   pre-chilling and after-ripening, after-ripening was the most successful
   one. Dent and segmented models were the most suitable models for
   determination of cardinal temperatures. Base, optimum, and ceiling
   temperatures for dent model were estimated 0.02, 18.97 to 25.32, and
   27.00 degrees C, respectively. These values for segmented model were
   0.01, 24.3 and 27.08 degrees C. The seeds showed high germination
   uniformity at 15 and 20 degrees C, but they entered into a state of
   thermo-dormancy as temperature reached about 27 degrees C. According to
   the temperature conditions of the studied region, early sowing of canola
   will result in the weed being faced with higher than ceiling
   temperatures. Thus, generalizing, the proper sowing date may be regarded
   as a feasible management practice in controlling this weed in any given
   area. This was the first report on estimation of cardinal temperatures
   in cutleaf geranium.

AB Intensive breeding programmes have been carried out to obtain
   high-quality seedless grape cultivars. Seedless grape cultivars were
   used as pollinizer parents, but the number of hybrid seeds and the
   viability of the seed obtained could differ greatly. In this study,
   carried out over 3 years, the results obtained from crossing with some
   pollinizer cultivars belonging to different Vitis species were compared.
   Maternal cultivars that do not need emasculation (male sterile) and
   emasculated cultivars were also compared. Evaluations were based on the
   total number of hybrid seeds and the proportion of viable seeds. In
   addition, the effects of various treatments on the rates of germination
   of the hybrid seed were compared. Although the female parents (with
   female flower structure) produced more seed than did hermaphrodite
   mothers in 2019, different results were obtained in cross-breeding
   studies in 2018 and 2020. Cold stratification was very effective in
   increasing germination by breaking dormancy of the hybrid seed. In
   addition, after treatment of cold moist storage (cold stratification),
   keeping the seed in distilled water overnight before planting increased
   germination. Although large numbers of seeds were produced by the
   genotype 86/1 and the cultivar 'Beyaz cavus', both of which do not
   require emasculation, many of these seeds did not germinate. Crosses
   with the cultivar 'Red Globe' as the maternal parent produced large
   numbers of viable seeds and high germination rates.

   (73.3%) was obtained when chilled seeds were treated with GA at 1000 ppm
   at 30°C under medium light intensity. GA at 500 ppm showed 50%
   germination while the 100 ppm concentration did not induce seed
   germination even up to 15 days. A flower enhancement study was conducted
   under greenhouse, nursery and mist conditions by spraying GA (100 ppm)
   monthly from October 1999 to February 2000. In the greenhouse and
   nursery, the fresh flower weight was highest in plants sprayed with GA
   at 100 ppm. With this concentration, greatest flower yields were
   obtained after 150 and 210 days of treatment under greenhouse and
   nursery conditions, respectively. Negligible flowering was noticed under
   mist conditions. The effects of farmyard manure (30, 60 and 120 t/ha) on
   flowering were not significant, while flower incidence was highest in
   plants grown at a spacing of 30*15 cm2 compared with a spacing of 30*30
   and 30*45 cm2. For in vitro propagation, root segments as explants were
   inoculated on Murashige and Skoog's (MS) medium alone or in combination
   with kinetin and benzyladenine. The medium was maintained at 5.8 pH with
   0.1 N sodium hydroxide before autoclaving at 121°C for 20 minutes. The
   MS medium supplemented with benzyladenine (2 mg/litre) produced the
   highest shoot induction (80%) in explants.

   digestive process on viability, germinability and germination rate were
   measured against controls. Results were species specific. Filled control
   seeds of all species were highly viable (>74%). Digestion by bears had
   no significant effect on initial viability, except for serviceberry
   (Amelanchier alnifolia) for which viability of seeds passed through
   captive bears decreased 14%. Percent germination of control seeds summed
   over five chilling durations at 1 C was significantly different from
   that of at least one bear ingestion treatment for, fife of the seven
   species. For chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), Oregon grape (Mahonia
   repent) and skunkbush sumac (Rhus trilobata), seeds ingested by wild
   black bears germinated to a significantly higher percentage than
   controls, but for snowberry (Symphoricarpos oreophilus) control seeds
   germinated significantly better. For serviceberry A viable seeds
   germinated after sufficient chilling, but germination of controls was
   higher than ingested seeds after shorter chilling durations. When seeds
   were prewarmed for 5 wk before chilling, percent germination of Oregon
   grape, skunkbush sumac and snowberry significantly increased. For
   serviceberry, prewarming lengthened the minimum Chilling requirement
   from 7 to 14 wk. Results from ingestion treatments suggest that the
   digestive process of black bears may simulate prewarming of seeds.
   Future work clarifying the role of bears as seed dispersers should
   involve characterization of: (1) scat deposition sites. (2) activities
   of seed predators and secondary dispersers at the scats and (3) the
   relative importance of bears in communities containing other dispersal

   stages: (S1) 25 and (S2) 40 d after anthesis; (S3) when fruit started to
   change color; (S4) when fruit changed completely of color; and (S5) when
   fruit was fully dried. In addition, seeds were extracted at two
   postharvest dates: immediately (IE) and 15 d (PE) after fruits were
   harvesting in each stage. Seed moisture content was 7.6 % in all
   treatments. The physical (weight of 1000 seeds, volumetric weight) and

   at PE than when extracted at IE, since extraction at PE from fruits
   harvested at the S3 stage rendered a germination rate of 93.4%, much
   higher than the 6.7 % rate obtained with seeds extracted from fruits
   harvested at the El stage. The best physiological quality was obtained

AB Many endangered plants such as Eryngium viviparum (Apiaceae) present a
   poor germination rate. This fact could be due to intrinsic and extrinsic
   seed variability influencing germination and dormancy of seeds. The
   objective of this study is to better understand the physiological
   mechanism of seed latency and, through artificial intelligence models,
   to determine the factors that stimulate germination rates of E.
   viviparum seeds. This description could be essential to prevent the
   disappearance of endangered plants. Germination in vitro was carried out
   under different dormancy breaking and incubation procedures. Percentages
   of germination, viability and E:S ratio were calculated and seeds were
   dissected at the end of each assay to describe embryo development. The
   database obtained was modeled using neurofuzzy logic technology. We have
   found that the most of Eryngium seeds (62.6%) were non-viable seeds
   (fully empty or without embryos). Excluding those, we have established
   the germination conditions to break seed dormancy that allow obtaining a
   real germination rate of 100%. Advantageously, the best conditions
   pointed out by neurofuzzy logic model for embryo growth were the
   combination of 1 mg L-1 GA(3) (Gibberellic Acid) and high incubation
   temperature and for germination the combination of long incubation and
   short warm stratification periods. Our results suggest that E. viviparum
   seeds present morphophysiological dormancy, which reduce the rate of
   germination. The knowledge provided by the neurofuzzy logic model makes
   possible not just break the physiological component of dormancy, but
   stimulate the embryo development increasing the rate of germination.
   Undoubtedly, the strategy developed in this work can be useful to
   recover other endangered plants by improving their germination rate and
   uniformity favoring their ex vitro conservation.

   incubation temperatures at 8 levels (2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35).
   After applying the priming treatments, gibberellic acid treatment was
   applied and then the response of seed germination at constant
   temperatures were assessed in the germinator. The effect of temperature
   on germination components was significant. Germination was occurred only
   in warm stratification. Generally, germination was started by a very
   slow trend and after seeds were set at incubation temperatures, at least
   40 days were lasted to germination occurred. There was no germination at
   2°C. By increasing temperature at a range of 5-15°C, germination
   percentage was increased and then was stopped at 25°C. Germination
   uniformity at 20°C was more than other temperatures. The meanest
   germination time was observed at 20°C and the least mean germination
   time was at 15°C. Gibberellic acid (single application) had no effect on
   seed germination. Based on two regression models, the cardinal
   temperatures (Tbase, Topt, Tmax) were (1.38-1.72°C), (12.75- 16.10°C)

   therefore, this study investigates the factors limiting seed germination
   of mentioned tree and how to troubleshoot them are discussed. This
   experiment was conducted in 2014 in a completely randomized design with
   a factorial arrangement with three replications in the laboratory of
   Horticultural Science Department, Gorgan University of Agricultural
   Sciences and Natural Resources of Iran. In order to remove physical
   dormancy (impermeable seed coat) mechanical scarification treatments
   with fine sand (shaking seeds and building sand for 5, 10 and 15
   minutes), hot water (70°C) and acid (treatments of seeds with solution
   of concentrated sulfuric acid for 1, 5 and 10 minutes and then rinse by
   tap water for 20 minutes) were used. Moreover to remove the
   physiological dormancy, stratification of seeds were applied for 30, 45
   and 60 days in 3-6oC. The results showed that the highest percentage of
   seed germination was related to scarification by sand (78%) for 15
   minutes and stratification for 30 days. The lowest seed germination rate
   among all treatments was related to control (4.6%). In overall, it can
   be concluded from various treatments which used to break dormancy in
   seeds of Firmiana simplex, it is clear that the seeds of mentioned tree
   include dual seed dormancy, including seed coat and embryo dormancy. The
   results also showed seedling establishment of 86.6% related to
   combination of scarification and stratification in the mentioned
   treatment has been much higher than other treatments, specially control
   (without scarification).

   germination. Germinated seeds were sown in pots with a mixture of peat
   and perlite. The treatments were arranged in a randomized complete block
   design in factorial experiment with 3 replicates and 25 seeds for each
   replicate. The results revealed that, nano-fertilizer affected
   significantly on seed germination and first stages of bitter almond
   growth. Whereas, pre-treating seeds of bitter almond rootstock with 50%
   of nano-fertilizer positively increased germination measurements;
   germination percentage, germination rate and index due to enhancing the
   amount of water that penetrates inside the seeds during the germination
   period which in turn improved the biological activity of stored food
   thus induced embryo to germinated early. Added to that, nano-fertilizer
   markedly increased stem length and diameter with producing stronger
   seedlings which had the tallest and deepest underground parts as well as
   length of primary and secondary roots/plant and number of secondary
   roots/plant. It can be attributed to that; nano-fertilizers are
   available for absorption and can provide all nutrients that required for
   plant growth throughout its slow release of fertilizer therefore reduce
   nitrogen fertilizer lost by leaching and elevate nitrogen utilization
   efficiency by plant comparing to other nitrogen fertilizers that are
   lost about 70% of its nitrogen content by leaching.

AB The influence of seed maturity, stratification, and seed washing method
   on seed germination were investigated for establishment of seed
   propagation system in dropwort (Oenanthe stolonifera DC). Seed
   germination rate was increased as period of the seed ripening increased,
   especially the seed over 40 days after flowering showed the highest
   germination rate. The optimum period of cold stratification treatment to
   promote seed germination was about 8 weeks. The seed treated by a cold
   wet stratification with sand exhibited higher germination rate compared
   to the seed treated by a cold wet stratification without sand. The
   stratified seeds that were stored in the ground having fluctuating
   temperature were improved up to 19%, while stratification stored under
   constant temperature (4°C) did not improve germination rate. In
   addition, 8 weeks of stratification period under fluctuating temperature
   in the ground was most effective. Sodium hypochlorite, vital oxide, and
   distilled water were used as chemicals to remove the germination
   inhibitor of seed coat. Water washing of seed coat after soaking in 0.5%
   sodium hypochlorite and 0.0005% vital oxide for three minutes and 60
   minutes respectively could effectively remove the germination inhibitors
   in the seed coat.

   GA(3). Seeds were also stratified at 5 and 25/15 & DEG;C for 6 and 9
   weeks, respectively, and then germinated at the same temperature. Seeds
   treated with GA(3) demonstrated an increased germination rate (GR) at
   all temperatures except 5 & DEG;C. The highest GR was 82.0% at 25/15 &
   DEG;C and 250 mg & BULL;L-1 GA(3) (4.8 times higher than the control
   (14.0%)). Additionally, GR increased after cold stratification, whereas
   seeds did not germinate after warm stratification at all temperatures.
   After cold stratification, the highest GR was 56.0% at 25/15 & DEG;C,
   which was lower than the GR observed after GA(3) treatment. We
   hypothesized that L. coreana seeds have a non-deep physiological
   dormancy and concluded that 250 mg & BULL;L-1 GA(3) treatment is more
   effective than cold stratification (9 weeks) for L. coreana
   seed-dormancy-breaking.

AB In order to study the influence of nutrients on the growth
   characteristics of the dominant dinoflagellates, Ceratium furca and
   Ceratium fusus, in the temperate coastal area of Sagami Bay,Japan, we
   conducted field monitoring from January 2000 to December 2005 and
   performed laboratory culture experiments. In the field study, population
   densities of C. furca and C. fusus were high, even in low nutrient
   concentrations (N: 1.58 mu M, P: 0.17 mu M). Both species were more
   abundant in the surface and sub-surface layers than in the bottom layers
   during the stratification periods. In the laboratory study, the specific
   growth rates of C furca and C. fusus increased gradually along with
   increasing nutrients up to the T-5 (N: 5 mu M, P: 0.5 mu M) and T-10 (N:
   10 mu M, P: 1 mu M) concentration levels, after which the growth rate
   plateaued at the T-50 (N: 50 mu M, P: 5 mu M) concentration level. In
   contrast, the nutrient uptake rates of both species continuously
   increased, indicating "luxury consumption", i.e., excessive cellular
   storage not related to growth rate. The half-saturation constants (K-s)
   of C. furca for nitrate (0.49 mu M) and phosphate (0.05 mu M) were
   slightly higher than C fusus (0.32 and 0.03 mu M, respectively). We
   offer two reasons why the two Ceratium population densities were
   maintained at high levels in low nutrient conditions. First, these two
   species have a competitive advantage over other algal species because of
   low K-s values and specific characteristics for nutrient uptake such as
   luxury consumption. Their ability to obtain nutrients through
   alternative methods, such as phagotrophy, might contribute to bloom
   formation and population persistence. Second, the cell densities of both
   Ceratium species increased along with nitrate concentrations in the
   media even when phosphorus was held constant. In particular, the growth
   of C furca was directly supported by various nitrogen sources such as
   nitrate, ammonium, and urea, although the highest growth rates were
   observed only in the nitrate-enriched cultures. Our field and laboratory
   results revealed that the growth rates of the two Ceratium species
   increased readily in high N:P nutrient conditions (i.e., conditions of P
   limitation) indicating an advantage over other algal species in
   phosphorus-limited environments such as Sagami Bay. (C) 2008 Elsevier

AB Seed dormancy is one of the most complex processes in response to
   adverse environmental conditions that has been reported in wild pear
   seeds. This research was conducted to investigate stratification and
   gibberellic acid treatments on wild pear seed germination from two
   intermediate and high altitude origins (2150 and 2450 m above sea level,
   respectively) located in the southeastern forests of Yasuj, Iran. For
   this purpose, seeds of wild pear were collected from two different
   provenances and then treated with gibberellic acid (0 and 1500 mg/l) for
   48 hours followed by stratification treatment (at zero, 30, 60 and 90
   days) at 4°C. The germination test was performed through a factorial
   experiment with two factors of seed origin at two levels and dormancy
   treatments at eight levels in completely randomized design with four
   replications in the seed laboratory of Yasouj University. The highest
   germination percentage (100%), germination rate (49.75 seed/day) and
   seed vigor index (17.9) were observed in seeds collected from high
   altitude and treated with cold-stratification (90 days) + gibberellic
   acid (1500 ppm). The results showed that the germination percentage of
   intermediate seeds with gibberellic acid + cold stratification treatment
   for 90 days (88%) was lower than the germination percentage of high
   altitude seeds treated with gibberellic acid + stratification for 60
   days (93%) and the high altitude seeds were reached the maximum
   germination percentage in shorter period of time. According to the
   obtained results, seed dormancy of wild pear is of physiological type.
   In addition, for the production of seedlings in the nursery, as well as
   for sowing to reforestation and enrich the degraded stands in Zagros
   forests; the use of high altitude seeds is suggested.

AB Hammada ( Hammada salicornica Bge) and calligonum (Calligonum
   intertextum Rech) are dominant shrubs of sandy desert areas of Khuzestan
   province, in the southwest of Iran, and they are used for sand dune
   establishment. Seeds of these two species were collected from the wild
   and subjected to different dormancy breaking treatments ( scarification,
   sulfuric acid, potassium nitrate solution, rinsing and soaking, and
   controlled temperatures), and to various salinity regimes. Scarification
   increased the hammada seed germination percentage, decreased germination
   time, and the rate of germination was significantly lower under saline
   conditions. The best dormancy breaking treatment for calligonum seeds
   was stratification at 10 degrees C for 50 days. The optimum temperature
   for seed germination was 20 and 15 degrees C for hammada and calligonum,
   respectively. Cold stratified seeds of calligonum germinated to
   significantly higher percentages than scarified seeds. The highest
   germination percentage and plumule and radicle lengths of calligonum
   were obtained at 10 to 15 degrees C. The germination percentage of
   scarified/stratified seeds of calligonum were lower than
   nonscarified/nonstratified seeds. Seed dormancy of both species is
   likely due to have a physiological effect. Seed germination was not
   affected by salinity up to 5 and 6 dS/m for either species; however, the
   germination percentage decreased and the time to germination increased
   with an increase in salinity. Radicle growth decreased more than plumule
   growth with an increase in salinity in both species.

   potassium nitrate and GA application had no significant effects on seed
   germination. Increased salinity significantly decreased germination
   percentage, plumule and radicle lengths and lengthened germination time.
   Radicle lengths decreased more than plumule with salinity. Optimum time

AB Tree encroachment in the ecotone between grassland and forest of
   interior British Columbia has resulted in decreasing grazing potential
   of rangelands. The 2 dominant tree species in this region, Douglas fir
   (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) and ponderosa pine (Pinus
   ponderosa), require stratification for seed dormancy release. The
   objective of this study was to determine whether seeds of these species
   can be stratified and dormancy released under grassland conditions.
   Field stratification experiments were conducted over 4 years using 2
   Douglas fir and 3 ponderosa pine seed collections. A laboratory
   experiment was conducted to determine the effect of seedcoat removal,
   light, and stratification duration on dormancy release. Dormancy in
   Douglas fir and ponderosa pine was released after 1 to 2 months of
   stratification under grassland seedbed conditions when seeds were placed
   in the field in late fall and early winter. Continuous stratification
   until the following May was correlated with higher germination rate. One
   week of stratification in the laboratory was sufficient to break
   dormancy in the 2 species and a similar effect can be achieved by
   exposure to light. Seed coat removal for ponderosa pine also released
   dormancy, indicating that this structure imposes dormancy. Therefore,
   the grassland seedbeds near the forest edge can provide suitable
   conditions to break dormancy of Douglas fir and ponderosa pine seeds,
   contributing to tree encroachment into adjacent grasslands. Managements
   aiming to control tree encroachment should take the interaction between
   tree seed and grassland seedbed conditions into consideration, and the
   control should be focused on the elimination of seeds and seedlings but
   not on the germination stage.

   Ethephon showed no effect in germination capacity in both clones. GA3
   exhibited a slight effect in endocarp-free seeds. Germination rate was

AB The relationship between seed mass variation and germinability in ten
   Abutilon theophrasti Medic. plants from a single agricultural population
   was examined under controlled environmental conditions. Seeds were
   collected in the autumn of 1995 and dry-stored in paper bags at
   4degreesC until the start of trials in the spring of 1998. For each
   plant, between 549 and 1000 randomly selected seeds were separated into
   seven mass fractions based on individual seed mass, with classes ranging
   from <6.0 to >11.0 mg. Subjecting the seeds to a cold stratification
   (4degreesC) period for 7 d followed by a 21-d alternating day/night
   (25/14degreesC) temperature and 14-h photoperiod regime, resulted in 75%
   overall germination, 24% dormancy and 1% non-viable seeds. The majority
   of the seeds germinated within 7 d of being exposed to the alternating
   temperature/light regimes. There was a significant (P < 0.001)
   difference in mean seed mass between the ten plants, with mean mass
   ranging from 8.8 to 9.6 mg. For nine of the ten plants, the greatest
   proportion of seeds occurred in the 9.0-9.9 mg mass fraction, while the
   lowest proportion of seeds was generally found within the 6.0-6.9 mg
   mass fraction. Most seeds (96%) having a mass below 6.0 mg were
   non-viable and, of the viable seeds, none germinated. There was a
   significant (P < 0.0001) relationship between seed mass and total
   germination, but not rate of germination. Germination peaked for seed
   mass fractions comprising the greatest proportion of total seeds
   (8.0-9.9 mg) and was lowest for seeds with high or low mass. There was a
   weak trend of lower germinability for heavier seeds (>10.0 mg) compared
   with lighter seeds. Maternal source had a significant effect (P < 0.05)
   on total germination and germination rate. Findings from this study
   suggest that intrapopulation variation in Abutilon theophrasti seed mass
   and its influence on germinability of seeds may play a significant role
   in maintaining a variable germination pattern and persistent seed bank

AB Societal Impact Statement Networks of digitized herbarium records are
   rich resources for understanding plant responses to climate change.
   While the climate is warming globally, some localities are experiencing
   climate cooling, the effects of which are poorly understood. Our
   herbarium-based study of a geographically restricted species shows that
   the timing of reproduction can shift earlier as the climate becomes
   cooler and wetter. Local variation in climate change may be a key factor
   driving the high variability of changes observed in plant reproduction
   and climate cooling should be considered along with other global change
   drivers. This will help enable accurate predictions for the successful
   management of climate change effects.
   Summary
   Plant phenological responses to global warming are well studied.
   However, while many locations are experiencing increased temperatures,
   some locations are experiencing climate cooling. Little work has been
   conducted to understand plant phenological responses to cooling trends,
   much less the combined effects of cooling and other factors, such as
   changing precipitation. Furthermore, studies based on herbarium
   specimens have been instrumental in demonstrating plant responses to
   global warming; but to our knowledge, herbarium records have not been
   used to investigate responses to cooling. We collected data from 98
   years of herbarium records to evaluate whether the reproductive
   phenology (flowering/fruiting) of an annual mustard, cedar gladecress
   (Leavenworthia stylosa), has changed as the climate has become cooler
   and wetter in central Tennessee, USA. Additionally, we conducted two
   field experiments to assess reproductive consequences of different
   flowering times. Over the last century, gladecress reproductive
   phenology has shifted 2.1 days earlier per decade, concurrent with
   wetter conditions during germination and cooler conditions during
   reproduction. Field experiments showed that plants with extremely early
   and moderately early flowering had equivalent reproduction, but these
   plants had greater reproduction than intermediate- and late-flowering
   plants. Counter to expectations from global warming studies, our work
   demonstrates that climate cooling and greater rainfall can result in
   earlier plant reproductive phenology, potentially due to asymmetric
   selection for early flowering. Future studies may need to consider
   climate cooling along with other global change factors to fully explain
   changes in plant phenology. Our understanding of plant responses to
   climate cooling can be enhanced through additional herbarium-based
   research.

   stratification and determined the expression level of gibberellins (GA)
   and abscisic acid (ABA) genes in coleorhiza. Both cold and biological
   stratification significantly (P < 0.05) enhanced the rate and efficacy
   of germination. The spatial distance between the fungal endophyte and
   the seed can be a determining factor of biological stratification as
   seeds in direct contact with fungal endophyte showed the highest rate
   and efficacy of germination. Consistently high expression of GA3ox2 gene
   was found in wheat coleorhiza throughout the tested period of
   germination. The expression of ABA biosynthesis gene, TaNCED, was
   substantially higher in cold stratification seeds, reflecting the role
   of abscisic acid in stress-adaptation. Overall, this study provides

AB 1. Traits are important for understanding how plant communities assemble
   and function, providing a common currency for studying ecological     
   processes across species, locations, and habitat types. However, most   
   studies relating species traits to community assembly rely upon
   vegetative      traits of mature plants. Seed traits, which are
   understudied relative to      whole-plant traits, are key to
   understanding assembly of plant      communities. This is particularly
   true in restored communities, which are      typically started from
   seed, making germination a critical first step in      community
   assembly. 2. We experimentally tested effects of seed traits      (mass,

   germination      is influenced by seed dormancy, and dormancy-break
   treatments are commonly      employed in restoration, we also tested the
   effects of two pre-treatments      (cold stratification and gibberellic
   acid application) on time to      germination. 3. Seed traits,
   phylogenetic position and seed pre-treatments      affected time to
   germination. Of all traits tested, variables related to      seed shape

   Phylogenetic position (location of species on the phylogenetic tree     
   relative to other tested species) was also an important predictor of    
   germination. Closely related species showed similar patterns in time to 
   germination. This was true even though all measured traits showed     
   phylogenetic signal. 4. Seed traits, phylogenetic position and

AB Traits are important for understanding how plant communities assemble
   and function, providing a common currency for studying ecological
   processes across species, locations, and habitat types. However, the
   majority of studies relating species traits to community assembly rely
   upon vegetative traits of mature plants. Seed traits, which are
   understudied relative to whole-plant traits, are key to understanding
   assembly of plant communities. This is particularly true for restored
   communities, which are typically started de novo from seed, making seed
   germination a critical first step in community assembly and an early
   filter for plant establishment. We experimentally tested the effects of
   seed traits (mass, shape, and embryo to seed size ratio) and phylogeny
   on germination response in 32 species commonly used in prairie grassland
   restoration in the Midwestern USA, analyzing data using time-to-event
   (survival) analysis. As germination is also influenced by seed dormancy,
   and dormancy break treatments are commonly employed in restoration, we
   also tested the effects of two pretreatments (cold stratification and
   gibberellic acid application) on time to germination. Seed traits,
   phylogeny, and seed pretreatments all affected time to germination. Of
   all traits tested, variables related to seed shape (height and shape
   variance) best predicted germination response, with high-variance (i.e.,
   pointier and narrower) seeds germinating faster. Phylogenetic position
   (the location of species on the phylogenetic tree relative to other
   tested species) was also an important predictor of germination response,
   that is, closely related species showed similar patterns in time to
   germination. This was true despite the fact that all measured seed
   traits showed phylogenetic signal, therefore phylogeny provided residual
   information that was not already captured by measured seed traits. Seed
   traits, phylogenetic position, and germination pretreatments were
   important predictors of germination response for a suite of species
   commonly used in grassland restoration. Shape traits were especially
   important, while mass, often the only seed trait used in studies of
   community assembly, was not a strong predictor of germination timing.
   These findings illustrate the ecological importance of seed traits that
   are rarely incorporated into functional studies of plant communities.
   This information can also be used to advance restoration practice by
   guiding restoration planning and seed mix design.

AB Although they are not fully satisfactory, laboratory germination
   percentages ar still better predictors of nursery-tree yield for both

   than any other means now available. Germination values, which combine
   both speed and completeness of germination, improve the predictability
   of nursery performance only in slowly germinating lots. Analyses of the
   reasons for better nursery growth of seedlings from stratified seeds
   reveal that under less favorable conditions they germinate faster than
   unstratified seeds. When equal-aged germinants from similarly-sized
   stratified and unstratified seeds are planted at the same time, seedling
   development is essentially the same. Seedlings from large-sized seeds
   (half-sib lots) did grow larger over a 10 wk period than those from
   small-sized seeds.

AB Prunus azorica is an Azorean endemic tree considered as a priority
   species for conservation. It is important as a laurel forest component,
   particularly at medium altitude, and as a food source for the endangered
   bird Pyrrhula marina. The best conditions for seed germination were
   investigated after removal of the outer layers of the fruit by
   determining the effect of 1) using stones or seeds; 2) stratification
   regime (six treatments and a control); 3) incubation temperature (four
   alternating temperature regimes); and 4) gibberellic acid concentration
   (three levels). This resulted in a fully factorial design with 168 (2 x
   7 x 4 x 3) treatments with three replicates per treatment and 25 seeds
   per replicate. Cumulative germination percentages were determined at the
   end of the trial. Globally, there was a significant effect of endocarp
   removal (49% germination with seeds and 15% with stones). Both for
   stones and seeds, there was a significant effect of incubation
   temperature, stratification regime, and growth regulator concentration.
   Stones attained a maximum germination of approximate to 80% under
   several stratification treatments including cold (4 degrees C) or warm
   (20 degrees C) followed by cold and at 10/5 degrees C without the
   addition of a growth regulator. Seeds attained a maximum germination of
   greater than 90% without stratification at 10/5 or 15/10 degrees C
   without the addition of a growth regulator. During the stratification
   process, germination occurred only for seeds, particularly for longer
   treatments, for example, those corresponding to 3 or more months of
   stratification, including warm followed by cold (75% to 80%) or cold
   alone (77%). According to seed morphology and germination results, the
   seed appears to have a non-deep physiological dormancy. Seeds of P.
   azorica can thus be efficiently germinated after endocarp removal at
   temperatures of 10/5 or 15/10 degrees C with a daily light period of 12
   hours. This protocol allowed producing hundreds of viable seedlings that
   were used in the reforestation of a laurel forest stand in a LIFE
   project.

AB In many forage legumes, hard seed coat is the main problem impeding the

   evaluated the effects of mechanical scarification, chilling, different
   seedbeds (peat and sand) and their combination on the germination ratio
   and time of 9 naturally grown legume species belonging Lathyrus and
   Vicia genus. Control seeds showed very low germination ranging from 0%
   in V. narbonensis and V. saliva to 24% in L. annuus among to species.
   Mechanical scarification highly increased germination in all the species
   ranging from 27% in V. saliva to 96% in L. sphaericus. The highest
   germination of all the investigated species (ranging between 100 and
   51%) was determined in the combination of mechanical scarification and
   sowing in peat treatments. Under this treatment, germination was
   improved greatly from 1% in control to 100% in V. bythinica while the
   germination of V. narbonensis increased from 0% in control to 51%. Any
   treatment which is highly promotes germination of one species generally
   accelerated the germination time of same species. The effect of
   treatments subjected to present study on germination ratio and time was
   generally, with exceptions higher for Lathyrus species compare to Vicia

   first experiment consisted of 5°C cold stratification (10, 20, 30, 40,
   50, 60, 70, 80, 90 & 100 days). The second experiment was composed of
   gibberellic acid (100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450 & 500 mg/L),
   benzyl adenine (0, 25, 50, 100 & 200 mg/L) and strigolactones (0, 0.01,
   0.1 & 1 mg/L). The third experiment was combined of the first and second
   experiments' best treatments including 50 mg/L benzyl adenine + 100 mg/L
   gibberellic acid, 200 mg/L benzyl adenine + 400 mg/L gibberellic acid,
   100 mg/L benzyl adenine + cold stratification at 5°C for 60 days and 100
   mg/L gibberellic acid + cold stratification at 5°C for 60 days. Results
   of the first experiment showed that highest mean daily, rate and
   germination percentage was observed in 30, 60 and 70 days of cold
   stratification respectively, with amounts of 1.86, 3.4 and 81 percent.
   Results of the second experiment revealed that gibberellic acid had
   significant impacts on seed germination, in comparison with control,
   benzyl adenine and strigolactone. The maximum seed germination was
   observed using 100 mg/L of gibberellic acid. The third experiment
   demonstrated that combination of 100 mg/L gibberellic acid with cold
   stratification at 5°C for 60 days increased germination percentage
   (81.25%), germination rate (5.23) and mean daily germination (1.35) for
   ten times, though its main effect could be attributed to 60 days of
   cold.

AB Studies were undertaken on seeds of the summer annual mudflat species
   Ammannia coccinea and Rotala ramosior to determine the (1) effects of
   flooding during late autumn to late spring on dormancy break and (2)
   optimum temperature for dormancy break. At maturity in autumn, about
   65-100% of the seeds of these species were dormant. Seeds of both
   species buried under flooded and under nonflooded conditions in a
   nonheated greenhouse germinated to 70-98% at 30(day)/15(night)degreesC
   and at 35/2degreesC the following June or July; seeds required light for
   germination. As dormancy break occurred, seeds of R. ramosior showed a
   decrease in the minimum temperature for germination, but those of A.
   coccinea did not. In another experiment, seeds buried under nonflooded
   conditions in the northeated greenhouse were flooded in November,
   December, February, March, April, or May, and all flooded seeds and
   nonflooded controls were exhumed and tested in July. With few
   exceptions, seeds of both species flooded for short (May-July) or long
   (November-July) periods germinated to significantly higher percentages
   over a range of temperatures when exhumed in July than did seeds that
   had not been flooded. In a third experiment, seeds of both species were
   incubated on moist sand in darkness at 5, 15/6, 20/10, and 30/15degreesC
   for 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 wk and then tested in light at 15/6, 20/10,
   25/15, 30/15, and 35/20degreesC. The optimal temperature regime for
   dormancy break in seeds of R. ramosior and A. coccinea was 20/10 and
   30/15degreesC, respectively. In the nonheated greenhouse, some dormancy
   break began in buried seeds of both species during late autumn and
   winter, and it continued as temperatures increased in spring and/or
   early summer. The ability of seeds of both species to come out of
   dormancy during flooding at field temperatures from late autumn to early
   summer means that seeds are nondormant when mudflats become dewatered in
   summer.

   days, to test germinability. When stratified for 120 days at +1 degrees
   C, almost 70% rotted versus 0-6% at -1 degrees C. While the higher
   temperature allowed 3-40% germination throughout stratification, and
   exposed the seeds to rotting, the lower temperature suppressed
   germination, and allowed flexibility of sowing date. After 30 days in a
   growth room the germination of the seeds exposed at -1 degrees C for 120
   days reached 100%, while those kept at +1 degrees C had the highest rate
   after 60 days of stratification, ranging from 56-96% depending on the
   cultivar. The seedlings from seeds stratified at +1 degrees C showed
   90%, 50% and 15% resetting after 60, 90, and 120 days respectively,
   while no resetting was found with the -1 degrees C treatment.
   Germination was correlated with lipid content (r=0.94) and seed dry
   weight (r=0.89), but not with protein (r=0.72), starch (r=0.49), or
   sugar (r=-0.47) content. Seed dry weight and lipid, sugar, and protein
   content, but not germination, were significantly related to time of
   ripening. Since germination rate was found to be correlated to seed dry
   weight and lipid content, attention must be paid to fruit ripening date,
   since early ripening genotypes accumulate less dry matter, and
   consequently give seeds with a low germination potential. Genotypes with
   low seed dry weight should be avoided as maternal parents in crosses,
   unless special care is taken to aid germination.

AB In SW Spain the winter annuals Anacyclus radiatus and Chrysanthemum
   coronarium (Asteraceae) are found as weeds in diverse crops. Both plant
   species are heterocarpic, i.e. the peripheral and central achenes of the
   capitulum are morphologically distinctive. In heterocarpic and
   heterospermic species the different fruit or seed morphs usually have
   differential ecological behaviour. In this work we have studied the
   morphometry, germination and dispersal timing of the different achene
   morphs in A. radiatus and C. coronarium Laboratory germination tests
   were carried out to evaluate the influence of incubation temperature
   light/dark, 27/27, 24/18, 20/10, 15/5, 10/4 degreeC), chilling period
   (0, 1, 7, 21 and 60 days at 2degreeC), GA3, nitrate and the dark on the
   germination percentage and rate (t50). The peripheral achenes of A.
   radiatus have a significantly broader wing than the central achenes. In
   this species, germination was inhibited in the dark but viable achenes
   of both types germinated completely under light exposure irrespective of
   test conditions. Nevertheless, the peripheral achenes germinated
   significantly faster compared to the central achenes, (t50 1.04 vs. 1.55
   days at 24/18degreeC. In C. coronarium peripheral achenes have
   three-winged ribs and are significantly longer, wider and thicker than
   the central achenes, which have only one-or two-winged ribs. In this
   species the peripheral achenes showed a much lower germination compared
   to the central achenes under all conditions tested (0.3-3.5% vs.
   41.5-58.0%). Embryos isolated from the pericarp of peripheral achenes
   germinated quickly in a great extent, and when placed in close contact
   with a pericarp fragment they did not show any inhibition of
   germination, suggesting physical dormancy. To determine differences in
   dispersal timing between achene morphs, we monitored dispersal in a
   stand of both plant species. In A. radiatus the peripheral achenes were
   shed first, at the onset of the rainy season in late summer, whereas the
   central achenes dispersed from late summer to early winter. In contrast,
   in C. coronarium the central achenes were shed first, from early summer
   to early autumn, whereas the peripheral achenes dispersed mainly in
   early autumn. Thus, in both weed species the more dispersible and
   readier-to-germinate achene morph is dispersed first. The differences in
   the germination and dispersal behaviour between achene morphs represent
   an opportunistic, mixed strategy which is favourable under environmental
   uncertainty, and should be accounted for in order to understand the
   population dynamics of both weed species.

   vigor) and five agents in priming (water, potassium nitrate at 0.2%,
   calcium nitrate at 0.2%, gibberellin GA(3) at 200 ppm and antioxidant
   riboflavin at 25 ppm), and the control; with four replications. To
   obtain of seeds with smaller vigor minus the deterioration was performed
   at 42 degrees C for 24 hours. The employee priming method was to
   hydration between roles, by 20 hours at 25 degrees C period. Germination
   and seed vigor were evaluated, as well as the emergence and seedling
   quality. Seeds with above vigor have better expression of the
   physiological potential in relation to the below vigor. The priming

AB Changes in population hydrotime parameters were determined during
   stratification in Polygonum aviculare L. seeds in order to model
   dormancy loss. Seeds buried in pots were stored at three temperatures
   (1.6, 7 and 12degreesC) for 110 d and were exhumed at regular intervals
   during the storage period. Exhumed seeds were incubated at different
   water potentials at 15degreesC and germination time courses were
   analysed to determine hydrotime parameters. The population mean base
   water potential (Psi(b)(50)) decreased concomitantly with seed dormancy,
   while the hydrotime constant (theta(H)) and the standard deviation of
   base water potential (sigma(Psib)) displayed only minor changes. Based
   on these results, a model for simulating P. aviculare seed dormancy loss
   in relation to low temperature was developed. The model employs
   Psi(b)(50) as an index of mean seed population dormancy status. While
   Psi(b)(50) was allowed to vary as seeds were released from dormancy,
   theta(H) and sigma(Psib) were held constant. Changes in Psi(b)(50) were
   related to the time and temperature, using a previously developed
   thermal stratification time index (S-tt), which quantifies the
   accumulation of thermal time units below a threshold temperature
   required for dormancy loss to occur. Therefore, Psi(b)(50) varied in
   relation to the accumulation of S-tt according to time and temperature.
   Model performance showed acceptable prediction of timing and percentage
   of germination of seeds buried in irrigated plots, but did not
   accurately predict germination of seeds exhumed from rain-fed plots.
   Thus, environmental factors other than temperature could also be
   involved in the regulation of dormancy status of buried seeds under
   field conditions.

AB A model for simulating Polygonum aviculare L. seed dormancy loss in
   relation to stratification temperature was developed. The model employs
   the lower limit temperature for germination (T-l) as an index of seed
   population dormancy status. While population mean for T-l (T-l(50)) and
   T-l distribution within the population (sigma(Tl)) are allowed to vary
   as seeds are released from dormancy, other thermal parameters
   characterizing the germination thermal responses (base, optimal and
   maximal temperatures, and thermal time required for germination) and the
   higher limit temperature for germination (T-h) are held constant. In
   order to relate changes in T-l(50) and sigma(Tl) to variable time and
   temperature, a stratification thermal time index (S-tt) was developed,
   which consists of the accumulation of thermal time units under a
   threshold temperature for dormancy loss to occur. Therefore, T-l(50) and
   sigma(Tl) varied in relation to the accumulation of S-tt according to
   time and temperature. To derive model equations, changes in seed
   population thermal parameters were estimated for buried seeds stored at
   1.6, 7 and 12degreesC for 110 d. Seeds were exhumed at regular
   intervals, and were incubated at 15degreesC and at a gradually
   increasing temperature regime in the range 6-25degreesC. The germination
   time-course curves obtained were reproduced using a mathematical model.
   Thermal parameters that best fit simulated and experimentally obtained
   germination time-course curves were determined. Model performance was
   evaluated against data of two unrelated experiments, showing acceptable
   prediction of timing and percentage of germination of seeds exhumed from
   field and controlled temperature conditions.

AB This paper develops a population-based threshold model to describe the
   combined action of sub- and supra-optimal temperatures, water stress and
   the release of dormancy by cool-moist stratification on the germination
   of seeds of Eucalyptus delegatensis R.T. Baker. Separate models were
   fitted for seed samples collected from five climatically differing
   regions. The model presumes that the time to germination of a given seed
   fraction is inversely proportional to the difference between the actual
   level of a given germination factor and the factor threshold. The model
   then assumes that variation in this factor threshold within a seed
   population as a whole can be characterised by a normal, or log-normal,
   distribution. By using physiological time rather than clock time as a
   metric, the model was extended to describe germination under varying
   conditions in the field.
   A number of applications of the model were demonstrated. The correlation
   of model parameters with regional climate was tested and it was
   concluded that site temperature affected both the mean and variation in
   base population sensitivities to stratification-dose but that site
   rainfall affected only the mean base population sensitivity to water
   stress with all populations having a common variance. Examination of the
   model parameters relating to the release of dormancy indicated that the
   increased germination rate associated with stratification could be
   accounted for by progress towards germination made at stratifying
   temperatures. Finally, the model was used to examine the fundamental
   regeneration niche of E. delegatensis and it was concluded that abundant
   germination in the field could only be expected when the soil water
   potential is above -0.4 MPa and temperatures exceed 7.5 degrees C.
   The model is presented as a flexible framework that allows for the
   prediction of field germination and as a useful tool for exploring seed
   germination processes, and the fundamental regeneration niche of the
   species. The modelling framework is easily modified to include
   additional factors and factor interactions applicable to other
   situations and species.

AB The seed germination response of seedlots from five geographically
   disparate provenances of Eucalyptus delegatensis to temperature,
   stratification, soil matric potential, relative humidity and interrupted
   imbibition was examined. The species was found to have a distinct
   temperature optimum of between 15 and 20-degrees-C, and a minimum
   temperature for germination of approximately 2-degrees-C. Short periods
   of exposure to high temperatures did not substantially affect
   germination performance. Stratification greatly increased the range of
   temperatures over which a high proportion of the seed germinated.
   Increases in the rate of germination with stratification are related to
   accrued thermal time during stratification. Pre-imbibing seeds at water
   potentials down to -2 MPa increased the rate of germination; however, no
   advantage was found after pre-imibibing at -3 MPa. This increased
   germination rate was associated with a shortening of the time to
   commencement of gemination and more synchronous germination. Germination
   rate and germination capacity were impeded by soil matric potentials
   below -0.01 MPa, and germination was totally inhibited by soil matric
   potentials below -0.5 MPa. Soil matric potential and temperature
   interacted in their effects on germination capacity, and seeds
   germinating at near optimum temperatures were less sensitive to soil
   moisture stress. Seeds survived dehydration within 60 h of the
   commencement of imbibition, but were increasingly affected by
   dehydration thereafter. The rate of imbibition was influenced by the
   ambient temperature and solution water potential. At modest levels of
   water stress, imbibition was not impeded and the reduction in
   germination capacity is probably due to the inhibition of growth related
   processes. Differences in germination response were detected between the
   seedlots and these could be related to the geographic origin of the
   seedlots.

   treatments on seed germination of Colutea buhsei Boiss. (Fabaceae) as
   one of the Iran native plants, arid-land and ornamental shrub with
   ability of usage in the urban landscape design. The experiment was
   performed with 15 treatments and 3 replications in a completely
   randomized design. Seeds were subjected to different treatments
   including various levels of GA3, concentrated (98%) H2SO4, cold
   stratification (CS), soaking with tab water, floating in hot water
   (100°C) followed by continual cooling for 24 hr in the same water and
   combined treatments. Afterwards seeds were sown in laboratory conditions
   to determine the factors' effects on germination percentage (GP),
   germination rate (GR), root and shoot length of Colutea bohsei seeds.
   All of these treatments, except for GA3 (250 and 500 ppm), increased the
   percentage and rate of the seed germination. Maximum germination
   percentage (66.25%) and rate (14.9 seeds per day) in 7 days was obtained
   at concentrated (98%) H2SO4 (15 min). Maximum root and shoot length was
   observed at concentrated (98%) H2SO4 (15 min) plus GA3 (100 ppm, 24 hr).
   Use of GA3 (100 ppm) in 24 hr after H2SO4 increased the germination rate
   and shoot length but this additive effect was not significant.

AB Sea buckthorn, Hippophae rhamnoides, is important for environmental
   restoration and erosion control. According to textbooks, its seeds are
   dormant and difficult to germinate without acid treatment or cold
   stratification. In studies to establish the best treatments for a quick
   and uniform germination, untreated seeds in two different seedlots
   germinated very well. Short treatments with sulfuric acid (no longer
   than 2 min) exerted a positive effect only in reducing mean germination
   time, while warm stratification reduced germination percentage. It was
   concluded that sea buckthorn seeds show very limited dormancy, and that
   treatment before sowing is uneconomic.

AB After harvest, M. communis seeds are characterized by primary dormancy
   which only gradually and partly disappears during storage. In our
   experiments, M. communis seeds were consistently found to be
   photoblastic positive. Application of GA3 or seed washing achieved
   partial dormancy breaking. When combined, these two techniques produced
   a synergic effect resulting in roughly 90% germination. Both moist
   stratification and seed soaking with a water solution of hydrogen
   peroxide were equally effective. However, only with GA3 was mean
   germination time reduced, by about 1 day. Seeds whose dormancy was
   broken (via stratification) showed thermal optima in the 25 to 30°C
   temperature range. The germination inhibition caused by far red light
   suggests involvement of phytochrome in M. communis germination.
   Therefore, propagation of this species by seed may be achievable through
   seed treatment. This indicates the potential for agronomic utilization
   of this species.

AB There is an increasing need for the landscape conservation of the
   threatened biodiversity of coastal ecosystems. This work studies the
   seed ecology (germination, dormancy, self-burial, seedlings emergence
   and seed bank disposition) of various Mediterranean hind dune
   wildflowers in a perspective of landscape protection and restoration.
   The deep dormancy of most species (overall Fabaceae, Brassicaceae and
   Calystegia soldanella) was eliminated or reduced after some seed
   treatments selected to simulate some natural events (washing, cold
   stratification, scarification, etc). "In situ" seed bank analysis was
   carried out by collecting sand samples in different dune ecosystems of
   Tuscany and Sardinia.
   Indeed the seed vertical distribution plays a crucial role in the
   germination dynamics on buried seeds. The vertical distribution of the
   seed bank of 20 selected species was confined to the upper 0-12 cm layer
   of sand dune. Their burial depth was found to be inversely related to
   the 1000 seed weight of the different species ranging by 0.01 g of
   Centaurium maritimum to 47.58 of C. so ldanella. Roughly 80% of the seed
   bank is accumulated in the shallowest sand layer (0-3 cm) and the only
   very little seeds of C. maritimum and Silene colorata were capable to
   reach the deeper layer of 9-12 cm. Seedling emergence from increasing
   burial depth has been studied in pots "ex situ". In spite of the
   respective seed dormancy-breaking treatments, their germination was
   progressively inhibited by burial depth increasing in the sand matrix.
   Calculation of the depth able to halve emergence established an inverse
   relationship between seed weight and depth mediated inhibition. In
   addition, the ex situ capacity for self-burial (mediated by winter
   rains), ranging between 1 and 3.5 cm, showed a similar, but inverse,
   relationship between seed weight and self-burial performance. Seed bank
   of herbaceous perennial species appears to be a good indicator of an
   ecosystem's health and the perspective of environmental restoration, by
   using native wildflowers, should be carried out by sowing treated seeds,
   with a light burial, behind the natural or artificial foredunes. (C)

AB A new peach cultivar named 'KU-PP1' was bred by crossing Japanese
   high-chill and Floridian low-chill cultivars for application in earlier
   forcing culture in Japan. To determine the optimal conditions for
   forcing culture of this cultivar, the effects of accumulated chilling
   hours (CH) and heating temperature on bud burst and flowering were
   examined in this study. The trees exposed to 240, 570, and 850 CH were
   grown in sunlit growth chambers with controlled temperature maintained
   at 10, 15, 20 and 25°C. The dates of bud burst and flowering were
   recorded. In addition, flower size and pollen germination rate were
   analyzed. Generally, longer chilling exposure and higher heating
   temperature hastened bud burst and flowering. Although this cultivar
   requires approximately 500 CH, our findings indicated that heating
   should be started from longer chilling exposure, such as 850 CH, to
   accelerate bud burst with lower costs for fuel used in forcing culture.
   Bud burst and flowering were markedly suppressed in trees exposed to 240
   CH; however, the high heating temperatures improved them to some extent.
   The increase in the heating temperature led to a reduction in flower
   size, and pollen germination rates were exceedingly low at temperatures
   above 20°C. Therefore, the avoidance of excessive heating and the
   provision of appropriate ventilation in the facilities are essential to
   ensure normal flower development under the forced cropping system.

   non-stratified seeds needed 15 weeks. Chilling for 6 or 7 weeks
   accelerated emergence compared to 3 weeks chilling.

   time (MGT). Germination ability of seeds from different sources
   (population) were compared to determine the effect of source
   environment. However, results revealed no significant variation in
   germination among sources. Compared to control, most of the
   pretreatments improved percent germination. The imbibed seeds prechilled
   at 4 degreesC for 20 days showed best (48.6%) response. Significant
   reduction of MGT and substantial improvement in germination (MGT 28.6 d;
   Germination 42.1%) was, however, observed for 100 ppm GA(3) (in
   scarified seeds) pretreatment. Considering practical feasibility and
   cost effectiveness, the mechanical scarification at micropyle end
   (MGT-31.6 d; mean germination 40.0%) was recommended as one of the best
   options especially for rural inhabitants. An attempt has been made to
   identify various attributes contributing toward seed germination
   responses in Myrica esculenta. The physical dormancy caused by an
   impermeable seed coat appears to be the main reason of poor germination.

   (assessed in terms of total thiol content and activities of superoxide
   dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase) in
   germinating tissues of rice (Oryza sativa L., cultivar Ratna).
   Imbibitional heat and chilling stress also induced oxidative damage to
   newly assembled membrane system by aggravating membrane lipid
   peroxidation and protein oxidation [measured in terms of thiobarbituric
   acid reactive substances (TBARS), free carbonyl content (C = O groups)
   and membrane protein thiol level (MPTL)]. Treatment with standardized
   low titer hydrogen peroxide during early imbibitional phase of
   germination caused significant reversal in oxidative damages to the
   newly assembled membrane system imposed by heat and chilling stress
   [evident from the data of TBARS, C = O, MPTL, ROS accumulation, membrane
   permeability status, membrane injury index and oxidative stress index]
   in seedlings of experimental rice cultivar. Imbibitional H2O2
   pretreatment also caused up-regulation of antioxidative defense
   (activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase,
   glutathione reductase and total thiol content) in the heat and chilling
   stress-raised rice seedlings. When the parameters of early growth
   performances were assessed (in terms of relative growth index, biomass
   accumulation, relative germination performance, mean daily germination,
   T-50 value), it clearly exhibited significant improvement of early
   growth performances of the experimental rice cultivar. The result
   proposes that an 'inductive pulse' of H2O2 is required to switch on some
   stress acclimatory metabolism through which plant restores redox
   homeostasis and prevents or repairs oxidative damages to newly assembled
   membrane system caused by unfavorable environmental cues during early
   germination to the rice cultivar Ratna. The importance of mitigating
   oxidative damages to membrane lipid and protein necessary for
   post-germinative growth under extremes of temperature is also suggested.

AB Four CsTK antisense transgenic cucumber plants were obtained. Decreased
   TK activity decreased the photosynthetic rate, seed germination rate,
   growth yield, and the tolerance to low temperature and weak light
   stress.
   Transketolase (TK, EC 2.2.1.1) is a key enzyme in the photosynthetic
   carbon reduction cycle (Calvin cycle). A cDNA fragment (526 bp) encoding
   transketolase was cloned from cucumber plants (Cucumis sativa L. cv
   'Jinyou 3') by RT-PCR. The antisense expression [(PBI-CsTK(-)] vector
   containing the CsTK gene fragment was constructed. The resulting plasmid
   was introduced into the cucumber inbred lines '08-1' using the
   agrobacterium-mediated method, and four antisense transgenic cucumber
   plants were obtained. Decreased CsTK expression either unaltered or
   slightly increased the mRNA abundance and activities of the other main
   enzymes in the Calvin cycle, however, it decreased the TK activity and
   net photosynthetic rate (Pn) in antisense transgenic cucumber leaves.
   Antisense plants showed decreases in the growth, ratio of female flowers
   and yield compared with the wild-type (WT) plants. The decrease in Pn,
   stomatal conductance (Gs), transpiration rate (Tr), photochemical
   efficiency (F-v/F-m) and actual photochemical efficiency of PSII (I
   broken vertical bar(PSII)) and the increase in electrolyte leakage (EL)
   were greater in antisense transgenic plants than in WT plants under low
   temperature (5 A degrees C) and low light intensity (100 mu mol m(-2)
   s(-1)).

AB Capsicum (pepper) is known for its poor seed germination, particularly
   seed longevity is usually much shorter than other Solanaceae. However,
   the molecular mechanisms involved are mostly unknown in these species.
   The present study examines the differences in seed longevity among
   Capsicum species and varietal types. Feral or less domesticated species,
   such as Capsicum chinense and particularly Capsicum frutescens, showed
   higher germination rates than the more domesticated Capsicum annuum
   after accelerated seed aging treatments. In addition, variability was
   detected in the expression of genes involved in the response to seed
   deterioration. The differences observed in ASPG1 expression led us to
   study the seed protein profile in dry and germinating seeds. Seed
   storage protein mobilization during germination was faster in seed
   aging-resistant genotypes. Similarly, the transcriptional change
   observed for the orthologous gene of the trans-species regulator AtHB25
   prompted us to study the structure and molecular components of the seed
   coat in peppers. All the Capsicum pepper accessions analyzed presented
   very lignified testa and we observed a positive correlation between the
   amount of lignin and seed viability. Our results provide essential
   information to explain the poor germination observed in pepper seeds and
   provide an experimental framework for future improvements in this
   important character.

AB Dormancy is a condition that delays or inhibits growth in seed,
   vegetative buds, and floral buds. Growth resumes in vegetative and
   floral buds after winter bud dormancy has been met by the accumulation
   of chilling hours and heat units necessary to break endodormancy and
   ecodormancy, respectively. Seed germination occurs after seed dormancy
   has been met by sufficient accumulation of stratification hours. A
   recent study in our lab suggests that the date of seed germination and
   the same seedling's vegetative and floral bud chilling requirement are
   not correlated. Correlations have been reported, however, between mean
   seed stratification requirements and mean bud chilling requirements
   among families. Prior to this study the number of genes involved in
   regulating seed dormancy and their location on the peach genomic map was
   unknown. Segregating F-2 seed was collected from a high x low
   stratification requirement F-1 hybrid in 2005, 2006 and 2008. Three
   experiments were performed in which batches of seed received varying
   amounts of stratification. Data on seed germination response, time of
   germination, and seedling development was collected. Genomic DNA from
   resulting plants was extracted and screened with SSR markers selected
   from the Prunus genomic map at an average resolution of 20 cM. Seed
   dormancy QTL were compared with previously detected vegetative and
   floral bud dormancy QTL. Seed dormancy QTL specific to stratification
   requirement and germination time were detected. A QTL region common to
   both seed stratification requirement and vegetative bud chilling
   requirement was found.

AB In developing countries, ornamental horticulture is usually
   export-oriented. In the vicinity of large towns in North Vietnam,
   flowering peach trees are produced for local markets only. They
   represent an interesting aspect of the temperate germplasm of Vietnam,
   and a special economic strategy is implemented. Very tiny fields can
   yield a high income, which has promoted the development of a real
   flowering peach industry, especially around the capital city of Hanoi.
   Red peach flowers (Photo 1) are essential for traditionally celebrating
   Tet, the Vietnamese New Year. This factor has led to the economic
   success of close-to-town horticulture. No parts of the overcrowded Red
   River delta area, close to West Lake in Hanoi, are wasted (Photo 2). The
   high retail price of flowering branches (15,000 to 20,000 dongs) and
   whole flowering trees (40,000 dongs) represents more than 10% of an
   average urban monthly salary. In the more market-oriented economy of
   present-day Vietnam, this high return has prompted high technical
   performance. Producers combine methods that are centuries-old with
   modern pest and disease treatments. Soil and climatic conditions are
   actually unsuitable for peach culture there. The excessive soil clay
   content (more than 30%) and high rainfall (1,800 mm/year) should rule
   out peach cultivation, which is highly susceptible to waterlogging. Any
   reasonable agro-economist would expect only rice production to be
   possible there. To overcome this problem, local growers have developed
   special drainage techniques (Photo 3) and orchard layouts (Photo 4). The
   work is all done manually, whereas buffaloes are used to cultivate the
   neighbouring paddy fields. One major variety, i.e. Bao Dich, has been
   cropped for centuries as its flowering coincides with the Tet
   celebrations and it has flowers with beautiful dark pink triple petals.
   Table 1 shows that the mean temperature of the coldest month (January)
   is 16.8degreeC, i.e. well above 7degreeC which is generally considered
   as the cold-hardening threshold for buds to overcome winter dormancy.
   This implies that Bao Dich is a peach with a low chilling requirement,
   which means that it is a genetic resource deserving close attention as
   no other local peach trees can be successfully grown at sea level at the
   low latitude of Hanoi (21degree lat. N). Bao Dich could be used for
   breeding new tropical peach varieties, as there is high market demand
   for this fruit. Local techniques have been developed to help produce
   flowers at Tet-time and increase flowering intensity, i.e. girdling in
   September and leaf-stripping in November. A standard flower orchard is
   cultivated for 5-6 years. During the last 2 years, rooted trees are
   prepared for selling. The branches are artistically twisted and carved
   to give a "dragon-tail" look (Photo 6). The reasons for the lack of
   fruit on flowering peach trees have been investigated. The ovary, style
   and stigma have a normal morphology, but the pollen germination rate is
   very low (Table 2). The income yield per hectare has been estimated as
   ranging from 33 to 133 million dongs. This is much higher than income
   from rice, and even exceeds that from lichi production. There is an
   effective distribution network, using bicycles (Photo 7) for sales in
   the streets of Hanoi. In conclusion, the successful production of
   peach-tree flowers for local markets, combining adapted technology,
   local genetic resources and cultural factors, is a good example of the
   development potential of, for instance, other temperate fruits in
   Vietnam.

AB Conditions in the parental environment during reproduction can affect
   the performance of the progenies. The goals of this study were to
   investigate whether warm or cold temperatures in the parental
   environment during flowering and seed development affect Arabidopsis
   thaliana seed properties, growth performance, reproduction and stress
   tolerance of the progenies, and to find candidate genes for
   progeny-related differences in stress responsiveness. Parental plants
   were raised at 20 degrees C and maintained from bolting to seed maturity
   at warm (25 degrees C) or cold (15 degrees C) temperatures. Analysis of
   seed properties revealed significant increases in nitrogen in seeds from
   warm temperature and significant increases in lipids and in the ratio of
   alpha-linolenic to oleic acid in seeds from the cold parental
   environment. Progenies of the warm parental environment showed faster
   germination rates, faster root elongation growth, higher leaf biomass
   and increased seed production at various temperatures compared with
   those from the cold parental environment. This indicates that under
   stable environmental conditions, progenies from warm parental
   environments had a clear adaptive advantage over those from cold
   parental environments. This parental effect was presumably transmitted
   by the higher nitrogen content of the seeds developed in warm
   conditions. When offspring from parents grown at different temperatures
   were exposed to chilling or freezing stress, photosynthetic yield
   recovered faster in progenies originating from cold parental
   environments. Cold acclimation involved up-regulation of transcripts of
   flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H) and pseudo response regulator 9 (PRR9) and
   down-regulation of growth-associated transcription factors (TFs) NAP and
   AP2domain containing RAP2.3. NAP, a regulator of senescence, and PRR9, a
   temperature-sensitive modulator of the circadian clock, were probably
   involved in mediating parent-of-origin effects, because they showed
   progeny-related expression differences under chilling. Because low
   temperatures also delay senescence, cold responsiveness of NAP suggests
   that this factor is linked with the regulatory network that is important
   for environmental acclimation of plants.

AB In temperate areas the advantages of early sowing of maize are
   associated with the exposure of seeds to chilling temperatures which may
   last several days during the spring. According to some authors immature
   seeds are more sensitive than mature ones to the inhibiting effects of
   chilling temperature on germination and early growth. This research was
   carried out to verify this sensitivity at different times after harvest.
   Germination and early growth experiments were carried out at 20.degree.
   C without  cold test (control) and after a chilling period lasting 8 or
   22 days on kernels of the well known hybrid B73.times.MO17 harvested at
   three different maturity stages. Our results show that, on the whole,
   seeds harvested before blacklayer maturity (BL) gave a better
   performance than seeds harvested ten days after BL. They had a higher
   germination rate and lower tendency to get mouldy. When the chilling
   temperature of the cold test lasted 8 days, early growth was enhanced
   while it was inhibited with 22  days of cold. The difference between our
   results and the conclusions of other authors is here discussed.

AB Carnivore consumption of fruit is a principle means by which many
   fleshy-fruited plant species achieve long-distance seed dispersal. We
   examined carnivore dispersal of hollyleaf cherry (Prunus ilicifolia)
   seeds, specifically assessing the survival, desiccation sensitivity, and
   germination of seeds found in bear scats. Studies were conducted both in
   the laboratory and in 2 burn areas in Los Padres National Forest,
   California. Bear scats containing P ilicifolia seeds were collected in
   burned and unburned chaparral. We counted seeds in each scat and noted
   whether endocarps had tooth punctures or rattled audibly when shaken.
   For comparative germination trials, we also collected fruits and seeds
   directly from mature shrubs. In the laboratory, following a cold-moist
   stratification period, seeds were assessed for germinability. In the
   field, we compared desiccation rates and germinability of seeds from
   bear scats and freshly collected seeds. We compared rates of moisture
   loss and germination for seeds subjected to several different
   conditions, including 25 degrees C (room temperature), 30 degrees C and
   65 degrees C (in the lab), and placement on exposed soil in a burn area
   (in the field), where midday temperatures were approximately 45 degrees
   C but likely much higher by late afternoon,
   Prunus ilicifolia seeds collected from bear scats were largely
   undamaged; the vast majority of these seeds germinated. In some cases,
   germination rate was higher for seeds from scats than for seeds from
   intact fruits. Several results indicate that desiccation is an important
   cause of reduced germinability. First, seeds that rattled audibly
   germinated poorly; and the louder the rattle, the lower the germination
   percentage. Second, seeds (both fresh and those from bear scats) placed
   in the field under protective screens had greatly reduced levels of
   germination (an 84% decline) after only 7 days. Third, seeds dried in
   the lab, even at relatively moderate temperatures, showed a decline in
   germination with seed moisture loss. The addition of high temperatures
   accelerated this decline in germination. We discuss the relevance of
   heat and desiccation sensitivity of seeds dispersed by bears to
   successful seed germination in burned and late-seral mesic and xeric
   chaparral.

   peat, vermiculite and vermicompost) and different temperature degrees
   (warm + cold) on the germination rate and seedling growth of rosehip
   seeds were investigated. This study was carried out in the laboratory
   and greenhouses of Kirsehir Ahi Evran University Faculty of Agriculture,
   Department of Horticulture, by investigating the germination of seeds in
   2020, which were stratificated for 28 weeks in 2019. Rosehip seeds were
   stratificated in sand, peat, vermiculite and vermicompost for 14 weeks
   at 22°C + cold stratification at 4°C for 14 weeks, and at the end of the
   folding period, the seeds were seeded in viols in the greenhouse. There
   was no emergence in peat and vermicompost, and the emergence rates in
   sand and vermiculite were 2.5% and 11.75%, respectively. When the
   emerging seedlings reached a size of 5 cm, they were taken into pots. At
   the end of the vegetation period, in rosehip seedlings, different
   morphological characteristics were determined including crown size, root
   collar diameter, stem number, stem length and diameter, shoot number,
   shoot length and diameter, root length, root dry and wet weight, stem
   dry and wet weight. At the end of the study, it was concluded that
   14-week warm stratification + 14-week cold stratification was
   insufficient in rosehip (Rosa canina L.) seeds, therefore, only the
   stratification and temperature were not sufficient for both short-term
   stratification and long-term stratification.

AB In this study, it was carried out on seeds taken from Tahar apples
   selected from Nevsehir province Urgup district and its surroundings in
   order to determine the propagation ability of Tahar apple, which has the
   potential to be rootstock for cultivated apples. After the seeds
   obtained were soaked in water for 24 hours, they were stratification in
   sand at + 4oC. The seeds, which remained in 60 days of stratification,
   were removed from the stratification when the signs of germination were
   seen from the ends, and planted in the peat + sand medium. The
   germination rate of apple seeds in stratification was determined to be
   90%. The seeds planted in the peat + sand medium were transferred to the
   land when they reached 15 cm in length, and the retention rates were
   100%. The vegetations transferred to the land have been observed in a
   vegetation period and have reached 30 cm in length and 0.5 cm in
   diameter. Consequently, due to the dwarf feature of Tahar apple, it was
   concluded that under normal care conditions, the slow growing of the
   seeds, and propagation of Tahar apple from seed was important for
   creating variation although it is a time consuming job.

AB Maize is one of the most important crop species worldwide, but also
   extremely susceptible to the effects of increasingly higher temperatures
   and drought during the summer and its flowering and grain filling stage.
   Different strategies are being utilized to ensure a satisfying yield
   potential and quality even in the extremely unfavourable environmental
   conditions, which are the result of climate change. Some of them are
   cropping pattern changes and sowing alterations, including earlier
   sowing. Since this implies the exposure to suboptimal temperatures
   during early developmental stages, it leads to a demand for developing
   maize lines tolerant to low temperatures during these stages. This
   research focuses on the first phase of germination, imbibition. Maize
   tolerance to low temperatures is a complex trait that includes different
   mechanisms and strategies that all work together to ensure adaptation
   and survival, such as cell membrane changes, antioxidative system
   activation, etc. Additionally, the low temperature response of different
   maize inbreds varies substantially, so recognizing the different ways in
   which they respond to low temperatures during imbibition and other
   earlier stages of development is crucial. To accomplish this, seeds of
   two maize inbred lines of contrasting susceptibility to low temperatures
   were selected and exposed to control (20 degrees C) and low temperature
   (8 degrees C) conditions during the first 24h of imbition and then
   further analyzed to assess their response. This included germination and
   tetrazolium assays; ascertaining membrane integrity by evaluating cell
   leakage and lipid peroxidation; determining the antioxidative capacity
   by assessing superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity; and
   expression analysis of four genes included in the low temperature
   response (gibberellin insensitive dwarf 1 gibberellin receptor, gid1;
   fatty acid desaturases 2 and 6, fad2 and fad6; plastid-lipid-associated
   2 protein, pap2). The results showed that, while there is not a
   significant difference in their germination rate, they differ in their
   survival rate, with more seeds of the tolerant genotype surviving the
   low temperature period. Significant differences between them were found
   in cell leakage (p<0,01), as well as gid1(p<0,05) and fad6 (p<0,05) gene
   expression assays. The present research brings light to our
   understanding of the effect of low temperatures on the first germination
   stage, -imbibition. It highlights the importance of choosing the right
   inbreds for earlier sowing and points to certain routes that could be
   taken for improving and accelerating the breeding process for low
   temperature tolerance.

AB Bidens frondosa is an annual weed occurring on mudflats with
   heteromorphic achenes. Central achenes are brown and elongated, and
   peripheral achenes are black and thicker. To identify differences in
   dormancy between the two morphs, germination of dry-stored achenes, and
   achenes stratified for 2, 4 and 13 weeks at 5degreeC, were tested at 15,
   25 and 20/10degreeC in light for two populations. None of the achenes
   germinated after dry storage or when stratified for 2 or 4 weeks.
   Significant differences in dormancy between the two morphs were obvious
   at 20/10degreeC and 25degreeC after 13 weeks of stratification.
   Periphery achenes were less dormant as they germinated to 75%
   (Furst-Puckler-Park population, FPP) and 65% (Spreewald population, SPR)
   at 25degreeC, while only 18% (SPR) and 45% (FPP) of the central achenes
   germinated. Germination was completed within 3 days. At 20/10degreeC,
   the germination rate of periphery achenes was higher than those of
   central achenes, but nearly all achenes of both morphs had germinated
   after 21 days. No germination occurred at 15degreeC. Central achenes are
   morphologically better-adapted for dispersal by animals. Their deeper
   dormancy and slower germination might be a strategy to reduce the risk
   of germination in new, unfavourable habitats. In contrast, less dormant
   and fast-germinating peripheral achenes with a lower dispersal
   capability remain near the mother plant and thus can replace it in the
   following spring.

AB The effect of temperature on the level of dormancy of primary and

   Primary dormant and secondary dormant seeds were stratified for 4 weeks
   at 5, 11, 13, and 15 degrees C, respectively, and tested for germination
   at 15/5 degrees C in light. To obtain secondary dormant seeds, primary
   dormant seeds were stratified at 5 degrees C and afterwards at 25
   degrees C for 4 weeks. Germination tests were carried out in water and
   in 25 mu mol KNO3-solution to examine differences in sensitivity to
   nitrate between seeds relieved from primary and secondary dormancy. In
   both species, seeds with primary and with induced secondary dormancy
   showed no significant differences in germination. The two sedges showed
   significant differences in the effect of stratification temperatures
   between primary and secondary dormant seeds. Primary dormant seeds of C.
   pendula showed high germination (>80%) in nitrate-solution after
   stratification at all temperatures, while only temperatures of 5, 11,
   and 13 degrees C led to higher germination in nitrate-solution in
   secondary dormant seeds. Germination percentages of primary and of
   secondary dormant C. pendula seeds in water increased to a higher extent
   only after stratification at 5 and 11 degrees C stratification of 11
   degrees C was more effective in secondary than in primary dormant seeds.
   The only temperature that relieved primary dormancy in C. remota seeds
   was 5 degrees C where germination in water and nitrate-solution was
   >90%. Germination of secondary dormant seeds was increased by
   stratification at 11 degrees C independent of the test solution but
   higher germination after stratification at 13 degrees C occurred only in
   nitrate-solution. The results support the existence of physiological
   differences in the regulation of primary and secondary dormancy by
   temperature, and in the reaction of nitrate, at least in C. remota.

AB The germination requirements of Zostera capricorni Aschers. were studied
   in relation to temperature, salinity and oxygen potential. In treatments
   maintained at 16 degrees C (corresponding to winter mean water
   temperature) and a salinity of 15 parts per thousand (half that of
   normal seawater), the cumulative percentage germination in both aerobic
   and anaerobic treatments was over 80%. However, seed germination was
   much faster under anaerobic conditions than aerobic conditions (cf mean
   time-to-germinate (MTG) of <41 and >136 days, respectively). Under
   anaerobic conditions, at a constant 16 degrees C, salinity level did not
   affect germination which was high (>80%) and rapid (MTG<41 days) at both
   15 parts per thousand and 30 parts per thousand. However, under aerobic
   conditions, percentage germination did not exceed 60% at the higher
   salinity, 30 parts per thousand, at the end of the experiment.
   Germination was also slower at the higher salinity, 30 parts per
   thousand, compared to 15 parts per thousand (MTG=159.6 and 136.3 days,
   respectively) but in both cases this was considerably slower than that
   recorded under anaerobic conditions. In all treatments held at 26
   degrees C (corresponding to summer mean water temperature) the MTG of
   seeds was high (>82 days) and the cumulative percentage germination did
   not exceed 40%. The effects of temperature on germination were more
   marked under anaerobic conditions than aerobic conditions. When Z.
   capricorni seeds were transferred to 16 degrees C, after 24 days at 26
   degrees C (where germination rate was very slow), rapid germination
   followed in the anaerobic treatments. In contrast, when seeds were
   similarly transferred from 16 degrees C to 26 degrees C, the germination
   rate decreased to a negligible level following a 1-week lag period
   immediately after transfer when they continued to germinate rapidly.
   After 5 months cold stratification in artificial seawater at 6 degrees
   C, both final germination and germination rate under anaerobic
   conditions were broadly similar to that recorded in unstratified seeds.
   In contrast, under aerobic conditions despite the fact that final
   germination at both salinity levels did not exceed 60%, stratified seeds
   germinated much quicker than unstratified seeds (average MTG value
   across both salinity levels, 51.2 and 148 days, respectively) indicating
   a reduction in the conditional dormancy originally maintained by aerobic
   conditions. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Peach seeds need chilling temperatures to overcome dormancy. The
   physiological bases of peach seed dormancy and bud break chilling
   requirement are considered strongly related, and this relationship could
   be used for early selection of low chilling genotypes. Peach seeds
   germinated more quickly under alternating than under constant
   temperatures. We studied the effect of the embryo genotype on the
   chilling requirement for seed germination. The seeds evaluated were
   obtained from the low chilling peach 'Campinas-1', which was either
   open-pollinated or crossed with the high chilling cultivar 'Miraflores'.
   The open pollinated 'Campinas-1' trees were surrounded by low or very
   low chill cultivars. The seeds (without the endocarp) were conditioned
   in sealed, transparent, polyethylene bags containing moist germination
   paper. The bags were placed in the dark in a growth chamber that
   alternated between 5 and 10 degrees C every two days. Germination
   percentages were grouped into four-day classes. Seeds of open-pollinated
   'Campinas-1' began to germinate twenty days after stratification and
   reached about 80% germination in the following two days. The germination
   of 'Campinas-1' x 'Miraflores' seeds began after 25 days of
   stratification, reaching 80% after 40 days of stratification. The seeds
   of the open-pollinated 'Campinas-1' germinated over a short period of
   time (from the 20th to the 27th day), whereas the hybrid seeds had a
   wider interval of germination time (24th to 47th day), showing the
   quantitative effect of the seed dormancy trait. The results indicate a
   strong effect of embryo genotype on the chilling requirement of the
   seeds, encouraging the selection of low chilling requirement genotypes
   based on seed dormancy. The alternation of temperatures favourable for
   overcoming dormancy with temperatures favourable for seed germination
   can be useful to screen genotypes with fewer differences in chilling
   requirement.

AB Clostridium botulinum is an anaerobic spore forming bacterium that
   produces the potent botulinum neurotoxin that causes a severe and fatal
   neuro-paralytic disease of humans and animals (botulism). C. botulinum
   Group II is a psychrotrophic saccharolytic bacterium that forms spores
   of moderate heat resistance and is a particular hazard in minimally
   heated chilled foods. Spore germination is a fundamental process that
   allows the spore to transition to a vegetative cell and typically
   involves a germinant receptor (GR) that responds to environmental
   signals. Analysis of C. botulinum Group II genomes shows they contain a
   single GR cluster (gerX3b), and an additional single gerA subunit
   (gerXAO). Spores of C. botulinum Group II strain Eklund 17B germinated
   in response to the addition of L-alanine, but did not germinate
   following the addition of exogenous Ca2+-DPA. Insertional inactivation
   experiments in this strain unexpectedly revealed that the orphan GR
   GerXAO is essential for L-alanine stimulated germination. GerX3bA and
   GerX3bC affected the germination rate but were unable to induce
   germination in the absence of GerXAO. No role could be identified for
   GerX3bB. This is the first study to identify the functional germination
   receptor of C. botulinum Group II.

AB Er-Situ Cultivation and In-Situ Management as Contribution to the
   Protection of Species The examples of Cypripedium calceolus, Gladiolus
   palustris, Gentianella bohemica and Gentianella lutescens The research
   study investigated the following issues: 1) To what extent can ex-situ
   cultures be established of species listed in the appendices of the
   Habitats Directive of the EU? 2) Which simple in-situ measures work to
   enhance seedling-recruitment? 3) Which are the economic framework
   conditions of these measures regarding ecological compensation?First of
   all, germination experiments for G. palustris, G. lutescens and G.
   bohemica were carried out in a climate chamber both in a laboratory and
   in outdoor pot-cultures. G. palustris and G. lutescens exhibited the
   highest germination rates when subjected to cold-stratification schemes.
   Fitness of juvenile plants was positively affected by moderate substrate
   moisture during summer months, moderate fertilization, good aeration of
   the substrate, and application of VA-Mycorrhiza-substrates. Multiple
   regression analysis revealed, however, that the number of flowers in
   Gentianella plants was significantly correlated with the pot
   depth.In-situ measures showed that in sowing experiments significantly
   more seedlings of G. palustris could be recorded in plots where
   vegetation and litter layer were removed. Similarly, juvenile plants of
   C. calceolus could only be recorded in plots where the litter and
   topsoil layer had been removed three years before. If topsoil and litter
   layer were removed in a patch around Cypripedium plants, these plants
   showed significantly more flowers after three years than untreated
   individuals.The calculation of costs carried out by a nursery showed
   that in-situ management and ex-situ cultivation of a Cypripedium
   population with the aim to yield material for re-introduction would cost
   15,180 over a period of eight years.Finally, the study discusses the
   in-situ measures investigated in this study as well as the establishment
   of ex-situ cultivation of highly endangered species and species listed
   in the Appendices of the Habitats Directive in the light of necessary
   ecological compensation measures.

AB NATURA-2000, the ecological network of protected areas in the European
   Union that has been included in the Croatian legislation, defines
   Community important plant species with imperative on their conservation
   ex/in situ. In the Botanical Garden of the Faculty of Science,
   University of Zagreb, five NATURA-species have been selected as research
   subjects for germination study to shed light on the topic of their seed
   ecology and consequently advance their conservation efforts: Degenia
   velebitica, Scilla litardierei, Klasea lycopifolia, Ligularia sibirica
   and Genista holopetala. The freshly matured seeds of each species were
   exposed to cold or warm stratification in duration of four to sixteen
   weeks, and their germination was investigated through different regimes
   of incubation parameters, i.e. illumination (light/dark) and temperature
   (5, 15/6, 23 degrees C). All species had higher germination values after
   cold stratification, with the exception of G. holopetala. We concluded
   that D. velebitica, K. lycopifolia and presumably L. sibirica seeds has
   non-deep physiological dormancy while S. litardierei has deep complex
   morphophysiological dormancy and G. holopetala has physical dormancy.
   The observed patterns in seeds' behaviour are consistent with the
   conditions in their natural habitats in Croatia and the knowledge of
   these patterns is vital for successful conservation strategies in the
   future.

AB Lettuce seeds have a high sensitivity to variations in humidity and
   temperature of the environment where they germinate, therefore, studies
   with the aim of improve the germination and physiological performance of
   these have been conducted. Thus, the study aimed to evaluate the
   efficiency of pre-germination treatment stratification (5 degrees C) for
   different periods, and increase the uniformity of germination of lettuce
   seeds submitted to different conditions of light and germination
   temperatures. In the pre-germinative treatment, the seeds of lettuce
   (Lactuca sativa L.) var. American Great Lakes were placed in plastic
   boxes dark of the type "gerbox" and subjected to temperature
   stratification of 5 degrees C and the dark for 0, 4, 8, 12 and 16 hours.
   After periods of stratification the seeds were submitted to germination
   tests which were transferred to plastic boxes type "gerbox" transparent
   (constant light) and dark (no light) and were maintained in a
   germination chamber B.O.D with light constant at temperatures of 20, 25,
   30 and 35 degrees C. The design used was the entirely randomized with
   four repetitions, in a factorial outline 5x4x2, five pre-germinative
   treatments, four germination temperatures and two light conditions.
   Stratification for 16 hours and temperatures of 20 and 25 degrees C
   stimulated the germination of lettuce seeds, providing a higher
   germination percentage, germination speed index and minor mean
   germination time. The presence of light resulted in increased
   germination at 0, 4, 8 and 12 hours of stratification.

AB Effects of chilling (5 degrees C) period, light and applied nitrogen (N)
   on germination (%), rate of germination (d to 50% of total gerinination;
   T-50%) and seed imbibition were examined in Clematis vitalba L. In the
   absence of chilling, light and N, germination was minimal (3 %). When
   applied alone, both chilling and N increased germination. Chilling for
   12 weeks increased germination to 64%, and 2.5 mM NO3- or NH4+ increased
   germination to 10-12%. Light did not increase germination when applied
   alone, but did when applied in combination with chilling and/or N; Half
   the seed germinated when light was combined with 2.5 mM NO3- or NH4+.
   The influence of chilling, light and/or N on germination was greater
   when Combined, than when either factor was applied alone; Both oxidized
   (NO,) and reduced (NH4+) forms of N increased germination, but
   non-N-containing compounds did ndt, Suggesting the response was due to N
   and not ionic or osmotic effects.
   Without additional N, T-50% decreased from 16-20 d at zero chilling, to
   around 5 d at 8 and 12 weeks chilling. Although T-50% was not influenced
   by an increase in NO3- or NH4+ from 0.5 to 5.0 mM, it did increase with
   additional applied N thereafter. However, the magnitude of the N effect
   was small compared to that of chilling. Like germination, seed
   imbibition increased with a longer chilling period, but in contrast
   imbibition decreased slightly with increased applied NO3- or NH4+. It is
   argued that increased imbibition is not directly related to an increase
   in total germination, but that it may be related to the rate of
   germination. Possible mechanisms involved in the reduction in dormancy
   of C. vitalba seed are discussed. (C) 1997 Annals of Botany Company.

AB Basalt milkvetch and western prairie clover are native perennial legumes
   distributed in the northern Great Basin and Columbia River Plateau of
   North America, with recent germplasm releases providing seed for
   revegetation. Although seed germination studies have identified
   scarification requirements for both species, and additional cold
   stratification for Astragalus filipes, no research has been conducted to
   optimize the likelihood of seedling emergence on rangeland sites. In
   this study, we planted both species in 3 locations in the northern Great
   Basin over 3 y. Seeds were planted in both fall and spring seasons, with
   emergence measured each June. For both species, there was variation in
   seedling emergence success across locations and years, with the Powell
   Butte, Oregon, location providing the highest emergence and the
   2011-2012 winter season leading to the highest emergence. For A.
   filipes, the greatest seedling emergence occurred with fall plantings
   with scarified seed because of a need for cold stratification and a slow
   germination rate. For Dalea ornata, because of its hard seedcoat yet
   rapid germination, the greatest seedling emergence occurred with spring
   plantings with scarified seed. Our data indicate a need for scarifying
   seed for both species, but planting A. filipes in fall and planting D.
   ornata in spring.

AB Studies on 10 varieties of cherry were made from 1955 to 1957. They
   showed that the rate of germination of cherry seeds depended on the
   biological properties of the variety. Seeds of the Lotovaya, Polevka,
   Stepnaya and Shubinka varieties had a high germination rate, and those
   of Vladimirskaya and Krasa severa had a low germination rate. When the
   stratification period was extended to 260 days and more, the germination
   rates of the seeds of some varieties increased. The germination rates of
   seeds of one and the same variety grown in different regions differed.
   The more southern the region, the higher the germination rate. The
   prolonged storage of cherry seeds in air-dry conditions sharply
   decreased their germination rate. Seeds from fruits harvested late had
   higher germination rates than those harvested early. However, seeds of
   the Vladimirskaya cherry from incompletely-ripe fruits harvested at any
   rate had a higher germination rate than those from completely-ripe
   fruits. The mechanical breaking of un-cracked stones after
   stratification increased the germination rate. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS:

AB The germination characteristics of Zannichellia palustris seeds
   collected from the spring-fed Fall River of northern California were
   investigated as affected by temperature, darkness, photoperiod, and
   light intensity. Darkness significantly inhibited germination; however,
   once stimulatory light levels were reached, germination time and the
   fraction of seeds that germinated were neither affected by photoperiod
   nor light intensity. The effects of temperature were assessed across a
   range of constant values from 4.2 to 40.8 degrees C. Seeds germinated at
   all temperatures except 40.8 degrees C, while the maximum fraction of
   seeds that germinated was observed at 24.4 and 29.5 degrees C, with 69
   +/- 5 and 73 +/- 3% total germination, respectively. Germination times
   were also fastest at 24.4 and 29.5 degrees C, where median germination
   was 9 d. The cumulative spread in germination over time was determined
   to be log-normally distributed, and was best described by a probit
   function for both individual temperatures and thermal units derived from
   linear regressions of subpopulations. These results, which deviate from
   those reported for Z palustris in other parts of the world, suggest that
   Z. palustris may be able to adapt to local conditions, such as cold
   spring-fed waters as found in the Fall River of northern California. (C)

AB Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) is one of the most important greenhouse
   vegetables, with a large cultivated area across the world. However, in
   northern China, tomato plants often suffer from low-temperature stress
   in solar greenhouse cultivation, which affects plant growth and
   development and results in economic losses. We previously found that a
   chloroplast aldolase gene in tomato, SlFBA4, plays an important role in
   the Calvin-Benson cycle (CBC), and its expression level and activity can
   be significantly altered when subjected to low-temperature stress. To
   further study the function of SlFBA4 in the photosynthesis and chilling
   tolerance of tomato, we obtained transgenic tomato plants by the
   over-expression and RNA interference (RNAi) of SlFBA4. The
   over-expression of SlFBA4 led to higher fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
   aldolase activity, net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and activity of other
   enzymes in the CBC than wild type. Opposite results were observed in the
   RNAi lines. Moreover, an increase in thousand-seed weight, plant height,
   stem diameter and germination rate in optimal and sub-optimal
   temperatures was observed in the over-expression lines, while opposite
   effects were observed in the RNAi lines. Furthermore, over-expression of
   SlFBA4 increased Pn and enzyme activity and decreased malonaldehyde
   (MDA) content under chilling conditions. On the other hand, Pn and MDA
   content were more severely influenced by chilling stress in the RNAi
   lines. These results indicate that SlFBA4 plays an important role in
   tomato growth and tolerance to chilling stress.

AB In northern China, low temperature is the most common abiotic stresses
   for tomato plants cultivated in solar-greenhouse in winter. We recently
   found that the expression and enzyme activity of
   fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolases (FBAs) in tomato, which are
   important enzymes in the Calvin-Benson cycle (CBC), were significantly
   altered in tomato seedlings subjected to heat/cold stresses. In order to
   study the role of FBA in photosynthesis and in regulating cold stress
   responses of tomato seedlings (Solanum lycopersicum), we transformed a
   tomato inbred line (FF) with RNA interference (RNAi) vector containing
   SlFBA7 reverse tandem repeat sequence. We found that the decreased
   SlFBA7 expression led to the decreased activities of FBA, as well as the
   activities of other main enzymes in the CBC. We also noticed a decrease
   in net photosynthetic rate, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate and soluble sugar
   content, stem diameter, dry weight and seed size in RNAi SlFBA7 plants
   compared to wild-type. However, there are no changes in starch contents
   in the RNAi transgenic plants. RNAi SlFBA7 plants showed a decreased
   germination rate, and an increased levels of superoxide anions (O-2(-))
   and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) under low temperature (8/5 degrees C) and
   low-light intensity (100mol m(-2)s(-1) photon flux density) growth
   conditions. These findings demonstrated the important role of SlFBA7 in
   regulating growth and chilling tolerance of tomato seedlings, and
   suggested that the catalytic activity of FBA in the CBC is sensitive to
   temperature.

   Capsicum chinense seedlings. The inoculum concentration effects were
   evaluated on seed germination rate, radicular system, and shoot growth.
   The inoculated seeds germination occurred a day before non inoculated
   seeds. An increase (P<0.001) in tertiary, and secondary root number, and
   in shoot growth was obtained. A significant difference of seedling
   growth (P<0.01) in sterilized and non-sterilized soil was observed. The
   optimal inoculum size were 3*107 fcu ml-1 and 1*107 fcu ml-1. It is
   suggested that inoculum size has played an important role as modulator
   of indigenous microorganisms interactions.

   different concentrations of NaCl (0, 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3%, 0.4% and 0.5%)
   was analyzed. Results show that the germination rate and germination
   energy of black locust seeds treated with NaCl for 5 d increased
   significantly, and their germination and vigor index were also higher
   than those of control if NaCl concentration was not more than 0.5%;
   followed by the seeds treated with pre-chilling for 10 d; the seeds
   would be injured with a pre-chilling time more than 15 d. During the
   germination the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase
   (CAT) of treated seeds all increased; the activity of peroxidase (POD)
   was higher (NaCl concentration less than 0.2%) or less (NaCl
   concentration more than 0.2%) than those of control. These indicate that
   pre-chilling treatment could improve both the salt resistance and the

AB Chilling stress is one of the major abiotic stresses affecting waxy
   maize plant growth. Melatonin (MT) is able to improve tolerance to
   abiotic stress in plants. To investigate the effects of seed priming
   with MT on tolerance to chilling stress in waxy maize, the seed
   germination characteristics and physiological parameters were tested
   with varied MT concentrations (0, 50, 100 mu M) and treatment times (12,
   24 h) at ambient (25 degrees C) and chilling (13 degrees C) temperature.
   MT primed seeds significantly enhanced the germination potential (by
   20.29% and 50.71%, respectively), germination rate (by 20.88% and
   33.72%), and increased the radicle length (by 90.73% and 217.14%),
   hypocotyl length (by 60.28% and 136.14%), root length (by 74.59% and
   108.70%), and seed vigor index (46.13%, 63.81%), compared with the
   non-priming seeds under chilling stress. No significant difference was
   found in priming time between primed and non-primed seeds. In addition,
   lower H2O2 and malondialdehyde concentrations, increased antioxidant
   enzyme activities (superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase and
   ascorbateperoxidase), and promoted starch metabolism were found in
   primed seeds compared to non-primed ones. It was suggested that seed
   priming with MT improved waxy maize seed germination under chilling
   stress through improving antioxidant system and starch metabolism, which
   protected from oxidative damage.

   germination of Coreopsis lanceolata L. seed. Highest total germination
   and most rapid and uniform germination of seed occurred at constant 15C;
   other constant temperatures and all alternating temperature regimes
   caused lower total germination or delayed it. Seeds tolerated - 20C
   during storage, but total germination was reduced below - 5C. Recently
   harvested seeds had 44% total germination, but 54% to 81% germination
   was achieved after 6 hours of soaking seeds in 1000 ppm GA3, 1000 ppm
   ethephon, or 25 ppm kinetin alone or in combination. Growth regulators
   reduced the number of days to 50% of final germination (T50), and the
   span in days between 10% and 90% of germination (T90 - T10). Storing
   fresh seeds without chemical treatment for > 6 months at 5C and 10% to
   20% relative humidity (RH), or 15C at 20% to 35% RH, increased total
   germination to 75% and 80%, respectively. Ten days were required to

   15C and 10% to 40% RH, with longer periods to T50 at other storage
   durations and RH levels. The germination spans (T90 - T10) were
   lengthened the higher the seed storage temperatures between 5 to 25C,
   with longer spans as seed storage durations and relative humidities
   increased. Total germination was similar after storing seeds at 5 or 15C
   and 10% to 30% RH and after soaking recently harvested seeds in GA3 +
   ethephon, but the days to T50 and T90 - T10 were shorter after growth

   the optimal stratification conditions: more than two weeks at 3°C
   increased the germination rate up to two or three times compared with
   the control treatment. As the alternation of temperatures plays a
   decisive role in germination for this species, a new stratification
   method in incubator was developed: five hour cycles (17°C in
   daylight/2°C in the dark) allowed reducing the duration of
   stratification up to five times. This technique will allow considerable

   or in water of electrical resistance 18 mOhm. Germination tests were run
   in Petri dishes and flats of potting media at 23° and 15°C in
   incubators. Final germination percentage and the germination rate were
   calculated. Over 70% of the seeds primed in H2O or Pro-Gibb T alone
   germinated during the priming process while seeds treated with NaCl or
   NaCl + Pro-Gibb T did not germinate. Under these conditions, Pro-Gibb T
   cannot be used alone as a seed pretreatment. Both the NaCl treatment and
   the NaCl + Pro-Gibb T improved the germination rate compared to the
   control. The combination of priming plus gibberellic acid produced a
   faster germination rate than when priming was used alone, especially at
   15°C. Seed priming plus Pro-Gibb T can improve the emergence rate and
   overall performance of chilli seeds at less than optimal temperatures.

AB The importance of monitoring biodiversity to detect and understand
   changes      throughout time and to inform management is increasingly
   recognized.      Monitoring schemes should be globally unified,
   spatially integrated across      scales, long term, and cost-efficient.
   We propose a framework to design      optimized multispecies-targeted
   monitoring networks over large areas. The      method builds upon
   previous developments on systematic conservation      planning in terms
   of optimizing resource allocation in space, and      comprises seven
   steps: (a) determine which questions will be addressed,      (b) define
   species to be monitored, (c) compile occurrence data for all     
   defined species, (d) predict the overall distribution of each species,
   (e)      collect relevant environmental data and identify homogeneous
   strata, (f)      set targets for the minimum number of monitoring sites
   per species and/or      stratum and (g) identify optimal monitoring
   sites. We tested whether the      monitoring networks designed with our
   framework have increased performance      when compared to networks
   obtained with simple-random or stratified-random      sampling by using
   a set of different indicators. To that end, we designed      monitoring
   networks using optimized and non-optimized sampling schemes,     
   applied to a case study in Portugal, where the goal was to design a     
   monitoring network for amphibians and reptiles, to complement the one   
   currently established in Spain. Results allowed us to conclude that     
   monitoring networks designed with our method tend to outperform the     
   non-optimized ones, in terms of higher species diversity (i.e. higher   
   number of species and equity across monitoring sites), higher     
   representation of environmental strata, and particularly higher coverage
   of rare species, with less survey effort. Synthesis and applications. We
   developed a framework to allocate monitoring sites for multiple species
   at      broad scales using predictive models and optimization algorithms
   currently      applied in systematic conservation planning. This
   framework presents field      survey cost-efficiency advantages when
   compared to other standard sampling      designs and can significantly
   contribute to improving the design of      monitoring schemes. Thus, we
   recommend its application to design new      multispecies monitoring
   networks or to extend existing ones. Marxan FilesInput files used in the

AB Germination responses and early seedling growth were examined for
   Grindelia glutinosa and G. tarapacana, two species that preliminary held
   and laboratory results had suggested could become a new resin crop for
   the hyper-arid Atacama desert in northern Chile. Initially we examined
   the germination responses to cold stratification and soil moisture.
   Stratification inhibited the germination of both species, but mostly of
   G. tarapacana. Best germination was obtained with about 50% soil
   moisture levels. Based on these results, we carried out factorial
   experiments with both species, two levels of nutrients and two levels of
   soil moisture. Although significant differences were not detected for
   the growth rate of the species, both benefited from nutrient and
   humidity additions. Germination rate of G. glutinosa was, in all cases,
   significantly higher than that observed for G. tarapacana. Resin yields
   were 17% for G. glutinosa and 26% for G. tarapacana, very high compared
   with the yields of other species in the genus.

   compared to peak of imbibition at 0.1 to 0.15 g/g). It is suggested a
   specific structure of the seed coat called semipermeable layer would
   play a significant role in regulating the electrolyte leakage. Chilling
   imbibition (5 degrees C) had a significant effect on numbers of atypical
   seedlings. Seed surface micrographs (SEM) revealed the existence of a
   dense network of surface seed hairs that facilitated imbibition by
   increasing the contact area of seed to water. Cross sections of hybrid I
   (Allflesh I 180) seeds, revealed the presence of gaps between the embryo
   and the endosperm. Those gaps were the free water accumulation area and
   therefore those seeds would be more exposed to imbibition damage
   compared to seeds of hybrid 11 (Cuore di bue) that lacked the gaps. Data
   from this study, would give some explanations for the low germination
   and poor crop stand establishment frequently observed under field
   conditions in plum tomatoes.

AB Water uptake kinetics of axes and cotyledons of Vigna radiata seeds has
   been studied during incubation at chilling temperature (4 degrees C) and
   under cycloheximide treatment. Germination rate of scarified seeds was
   faster than intact seeds, and this happens in correlation with their
   comparative water uptake kinetics. Chilling temperature during
   incubation significantly slowed down water uptake by both intact and
   scarified seeds. Treatment with cycloheximide was also somewhat
   effective in retarding water uptake, but only in scarified seeds. Water
   uptake by axes isolated from intact seeds (attached or detached from the
   cotyledons) was inhibited completely by chilling temperature as well as
   by cycloheximide treatment while these treatments were ineffective in
   preventing water uptake by cotyledons. In the case of scarified seeds,
   such treatments again inhibited water uptake by axes only, the effect
   being more prominent in attached ones. Preincubation of intact seeds
   with cycloheximide for 6 h also inhibited water uptake by isolated axes,
   but not by cotyledons, during subsequent incubation in water.

AB In seasonal climates, germination timing is mainly controlled by
   temperature, especially in species with physiological seed dormancy. The
   germination response to temperature may, however, vary among populations
   across the distribution range of species. Understanding how populations
   along climate gradients vary in their sensitivity to temperature is
   important for determining their vulnerability to climate variability and
   change. Here, we investigated the germination response of two Erica
   species with physiological seed dormancy (E. australis and E. umbellata)
   to changes in temperature throughout the seasons (simulated autumn
   through to spring) and to the local climate in six localities across a
   latitudinal gradient in western Iberia. Effects were studied with and
   without exposing the seeds to a heat shock. The local climate of seed
   provenance emerged as a key factor in modifying the germination
   sensitivity to germination temperature and their variation through the
   seasons. Although each species showed idiosyncratic germination
   responses to temperature treatments and across the gradient, germination
   of both species was sensitive to warmer temperatures and to a heat
   shock. Both showed similar seasonal germination patterns: as we moved
   from south to north, populations tended to have a larger germination
   peak in spring, which was greater at colder temperatures. We conclude
   that rising temperatures associated with climate change will affect
   these species, particularly at their northern ranges, where many seeds
   will remain dormant during warmer winters. Arguably, models aiming at
   assessing climate change impacts in these species need to include such
   variability across latitude.

AB PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Species differ in their temperature germination
   niche. Populations of a species may similarly differ across the
   distribution range of the species. Anticipating the impacts of climate
   variability and change requires understanding the differential
   sensitivity to germination temperature among and within species. Here we
   studied the germination responses of four hard-seeded Cistaceae seeders
   to a range of current and future temperatures.
   METHODS: Seeds were collected at sites across the Iberian Peninsula and
   exposed or not exposed to a heat shock to break dormancy, then set to
   germinate under four temperature regimes. Temperatures were varied daily
   and seasonally, simulating the temperature range across the gradient,
   plus an increased temperature simulating future climate. Time to
   germination onset and cumulative germination at the end of each season
   were analyzed for the effects of temperature treatments, seasons, and
   local climate (temperature of the germination period, T-gp) at each
   site.
   KEY RESULTS: T-gp was a significant covariate of germination in all
   species but Cistus populifolius. Temperature treatments significantly
   affected Cistus ladanifer, C. salviifolius, and Halimium ocymoides.
   Germination occurred in simulated autumn conditions, with little
   germination occurring at later seasons, except in unheated seeds of H.
   ocymoides. Exposure to a heat shock changed the sensitivity to
   temperature treatments and the relationships with T-gp.
   CONCLUSIONS: Germination responses to temperature differ not only among
   species but also within species across their latitudinal range. The
   responses were idiosyncratic and related to the local climate of the
   population. This germination variability complicates generalizing the
   impacts of climate variability and climate change.

AB The use of chemical insecticides in the management of whitefly (Bemisia
   tabaci) (Gennadius) causes serious damage to the environment and has
   generated populations resistant to conventional products. A promising
   alternative is biological control by using entomopathogenic fungi. In
   the present study the in vitro development and pathogenicity of four
   native strains (Pf-Tim-Tiz Pf, Pf-Hal, Pf-Rg), as well as a commercial
   (Pae-sin) of Paecilomyces fumosoroseus (Wize) Brown & Smith were
   evaluated in eggs and first instar nymphs of Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius).
   The variables to assess the in vitro development were: daily growth rate
   of the colony (TCD), sporulation and spore germination rate (TGE). The
   pathogenicity of the strains was determined by dipping the leaves of
   Capsicum chinense, which contained the immature stages of B. tabaci in a
   conidial suspension 1x10(7) spores mL(-1). The TCD of the strain Pae-sin
   (1.63 mm d(-1)) was higher (p <= 0.05) than that of Pf-Hal (1.40 mm
   d(-1)) and Pf-Itg (1.35 mm d(-1) Sporulation was not different (p> 0.05)
   between native isolates and the commercial strain. The TGE was higher (p
   <= 0.05) in Pf-Rg (22 % h(-1)) than that observed in other native
   strains and Pae-sin (11.91 to 12.50 %). All fungi were more pathogenic
   in nymphs than in eggs; the mortality of eggs and nymphs ranged from
   29.8 to 45.5 % and from 51.4 to 74.5 %. With the data of mortality in
   nymphs, mean lethal time (LT50) and the area under the curve of
   cumulative mortality (ABCMA) were calculated. The lowest values of LT50
   and the highest of ABCMA were observed in the strain Pae-sin with 3.2 d
   and 311.93 units and in Pf-Hal with 3.7 d and 301.93 units. The analysis
   of the results indicates that there was no clear relationship between
   the in vitro development capacity of the isolates and their virulence on
   B. tabaci immature stages.

   four cultivars with weak low-temperature-resistance (Luhua 11, Baisha

   seed germination and physiological indexes of seedlings under low
   temperature (4°C) and GA3 treatments. There was no significant
   difference in rate of emergence and germination index of strong
   low-temperature-resistant cultivars with or without 4°C treatments, but
   decrease in hypocotyl length and seed vigor under low temperature. The
   relative membrane permeability and MDA content of four cultivars with
   weak low-temperature-resistance had higher ascensional range. The
   contents of soluble sugar, soluble protein and free proline of cultivars
   with strong low-temperature resistance had smaller reduction. GA3
   facilitated the rate of emergence and seed vigor of all peanut seeds, as
   well as promoted the contents of soluble sugar, soluble protein and free
   proline of seedlings, but suppressed the uptrend of relative membrane
   permeability and MDA content of peanut seedlings under low temperature.
   The best concentration of GA3 promoting seed germination and seedling
   growth of peanut with low temperature treatment is 300 mol L-1. The rate
   of emergence had significantly negative correlation with relative
   membrane permeability and MDA, and obviously positive correlation with
   the contents of soluble sugar or free proline. The temperature had
   greater influence on germination rate, but the effect of gibberellin on
   difference of germination rate between different varieties was smaller.
   This study provided a theoretical basis for germplasm resources
   innovation and breeding new peanut cultivars with strong low-temperature
   resistance, as well as for studying the physiological mechanism of
   gibberellin on chilling tolerance of different peanut varieties.

   months. This study employed moist stratification, submersion, and
   detached seed endocarp to investigate the degree of seed dormancy and
   the measures to break dormancy and to facilitate germination. Under the
   stratification at temperatures of 4, 10, 15, 20, 20/25°C for 2-12 weeks,
   the seed germination ratios increased with the increase of
   stratification period, and the mean germination time required decreased.
   Seed germination were found initiated after the stratification
   treatments of 10, 15, 20°C for 6 weeks. Dissection of stratified seeds
   at 15°C found that the length of embryo in seeds increased with the
   increase of storage period. The result demonstrated that the embryo in
   the seed was not completely developed when the fruits of V.
   odoratissimum ripened. After ripening was need for germination of the
   undeveloped embryo in the seeds. Under the different temperatures at 10,
   15 and 20°C, seed germination ratios were higher, and mean germination
   time required also significantly reduced. Effects of seed endocarp
   existence on the treatments of different immersion time were also
   investigated. Although germination ratios did not differ significantly,
   mean germination time required for seeds without endocarp decreased more
   significantly than that for seeds with endocarp. In general, the seeds
   of V. odoratissimum require warm stratification to break dormancy.
   Results indicated that the seeds of V. odoratissimum were non-deep
   simple morphophysiological dormancy. Suitable temperature for
   germination was between 10-20°C. germinated About half of germination
   time were required for the seeds without endocarp, compared to times for

AB The seeds of Lithocarpus lepidocarpus (Hayata) Hayata, after being

   longest survival period of 54 months. However, the highist germination
   rate is attained after being stored for 10 to 12 months and declined
   after 24 months. If stored at 4 degrees C chilling stratification, the
   shell-cracking rate (including germination rate) of seeds with shell was
   about 20%, 25%, 30%, 40%, and 50-70% after storage for 6 months,10
   months, 12 months, 14 months and 24 months, respectively. Being put at
   30 degrees C/20 degrees C (under light/dark 12hr/12hr), cracked seeds
   might grow roots longer than 2cm in 14 days. During 2 years of storage,
   active seeds after ex-shelling all germinated normally if sowed. The
   mean germination time (MGT) of above seeds was within 25 days.
   Ex-shelled seeds were undurable for storage at room temperature, might
   be stored for only 6 months at 4 degrees C chilling stratification.
   Stored at 4 degrees C chilling stratification for over 12 months, root
   growth of shell-cracked seeds might be depressed by low temperature and
   then the storage period might be extended to 6 to 9 months more. But
   after germination if still stored at 4 degrees C chilling stratification
   for 10 months more, roots were often injured and unable to become
   seedlings. The seeds dormancy of Lithocarpus lepidocarpus is closely
   related to shell existence and together with some physical dormancy
   phenomena. However, further research is necessary for the understanding
   of detailed mechanism.

AB Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is an emerging bioenergy crop in the
   US, but little has been done by breeders to improve its poor seed
   germination and slow and inconsistent establishment. The objective of
   this study was to evaluate the effects of divergent selection for seed
   weight on germination in three switchgrass populations over two cycles
   with and without a cold stratification treatment. Seed from switchgrass
   populations 9064202, 'Carthage', and 'Timber' was sorted into light and
   heavy weight classes via a gravity deck and germinated in a growth
   chamber. Seedlings were planted to the field in isolated crossing
   blocks. Seed from these blocks was sorted and germinated following a
   divergent selection scheme for a second cycle. Seed was harvested from
   all derived crossing blocks representing all cycles of selection and
   subjected to a cold or no stratification treatment and germinated in a
   growth chamber. One cycle of selection for heavy seed resulted in an
   increase in progeny seed weight in 9064202 and Carthage but not Timber.
   A second cycle of selection gave unexpected results, probably due to the
   effects of genetic drift. The effect of seed weight was not significant
   for germination percentage or germination rate index. Dormancy had a
   larger impact on overall germination and germination rate than seed
   weight in the populations tested. Therefore, selection efforts focused
   on reducing dormancy rather than increasing seed weight are likely to be
   more successful in improving overall germination and germination rate in
   switchgrass population 9064202 and cultivars Carthage and Timber.

AB Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is a valuable forage grass and shows
   great potential as a renewable biofuel crop. In establishment from seed,
   the failure of the seeds to germinate can lead to reductions in plant
   growth and final crop yield. Using an orthogonal matrix design,
   sonication treatment conditions were optimised to enhance switchgrass
   seed vigour. Three factors, sonication time (A), temperature (B) and
   ultrasound output power (C), were considered. Seed germination
   potential, mean germination time and germination rate index were used as
   parameters of seed vigour. Sonication temperature was identified as the
   factor with the largest effect on switchgrass seed vigour, followed by
   sonication time and ultrasound output power. Maximal seed vigour was
   obtained by sonication for 25 minutes at 35 degrees C with an output
   power of 200W. These results provide the basis for using ultrasound to
   enhance switchgrass seed vigour.

AB Climate change has already triggered species distribution shifts along
   the elevation gradient in many mountainous regions. Seed germination and
   seedling survival of Euptelea pleiospermum with different seed sources
   were examined under different elevations, aspects, in the forest or in
   the gap,and in spring or winter. The results showed that gaps were
   necessary for seedling survival and establishment. Furthermore, seed
   germination rate and seedling survival rate were not significantly
   different between the population at higher elevations (2090 m and 2350
   m) and population from intermediate elevation (1600 m), but populations
   at 2220 m were lower. Seed germination rate and seedling survival of the
   population at lower elevations (900 m and 750 m) were lower than at the
   intermediate elevations, but at 620 m were as high as intermediate
   elevation. In addition, seed sources and aspect had no significant
   effect on seed germination and seedling survival rate. Cold
   stratification at high altitude had negative influences on seed
   germination and seedling survival. These findings suggest that E.
   pleiospermum has the potential to move to higher elevation.
   Furthermore,forest gaps,which are not frequent,are necessary for
   seedling survival and establishment, indicating the limited population
   shift of E. pleiospermum to higher elevations. Finally,populations in
   lower elevations will be vulnerable to future climate change due to poor
   seedling recruitment,which may be mediated by some scattered suitable
   habitats.

TI Seed Dormancy Release and Germination Requirements of Cinnamomum migao,

AB Seed dormancy is a complex adaptive trait of plants that are influenced
   by several physiological and environmental factors. The endangered plant
   Cinnamomum migao is also known to exhibit seed dormancy and low
   germination, which may influence its regeneration; however, these
   characteristics remain unexplored. To our knowledge, this study is the
   first to examine the type of dormancy and improve the germination
   percentage of C. migao seeds. We evaluated the structure and
   characteristics of the embryo and endocarp of C. migao seeds as well as
   the effects of endogenous inhibitors. Furthermore, we assessed the
   effects of light, stratification, alternating temperature, and
   gibberellic acid 3 (GA(3)) on the dormancy release of these seeds. The
   embryo was well developed the endocarp was water-permeable, and no
   obvious mechanical hindrance to germination was observed. However, the
   endocarp and embryo contained phenols and other germination inhibitors.
   The seed extracts of C. migao delayed the germination of cabbage and
   ryegrass seeds, which indicates the presence of endogenous inhibitors.
   These findings suggest that C. migao seeds exhibit physiological
   dormancy. Light and an alternating temperature (15/20 degrees C) did not
   influence germination. However, GA(3) pretreatment, alternating
   temperatures, and warm stratification relieved dormancy. GA(3)
   pretreatment combined with the 15 degrees C stratification treatment was
   most effective in rapidly releasing the C. migao seed dormancy. Our
   findings may facilitate the storage and conservation of this endangered
   plant, which is currently underrepresented in ex situ collections.

AB S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC) is a key enzyme for synthesis
   of polyamines, regulating plant growth and development as well as plant
   stress responses. Transgenic rice plants down-regulating OsSAMDC2 were
   generated by RNA interference. Transcript levels of OsSAMDC2, OsSAMDC1
   and OsSAMDC4 were all reduced in transgenic rice, along with decreased
   levels of sperimidine (Spd) and spermin (Spm) and polyamine oxidase
   activity. The transgenic lines showed a reduced apical dominance
   phenotype with lower plant length, higher tiller numbers, reduced and
   delayed seed germination rate, and decreased pollen viability, seed
   setting rate and grain yield per plant. Tolerance to multiple abiotic
   stresses (drought, salinity, and chilling) was also reduced in
   transgenic plants in association with inhibition of antioxidant enzyme
   activities under stressed conditions. Our results suggest that Spd and
   Spm are essential for maintenance of normal plant growth, pollen
   viability, seed setting rate, grain yield and stress tolerance in rice.

AB Tea seed is believed to be recalcitrant based on its sensitivity to
   chilling or drying stress. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alterations
   in cytosolic redox status have been implicated in intolerance to
   desiccation by recalcitrant seed, but there is little information
   available regarding how ROS are regulated in seeds susceptible to drying
   stress. We investigated changes in protein expression and activity in
   tea embryo in response to desiccation using physiological and proteomic
   methods. Results showed that desiccation treatment dramatically induced
   the accumulation of H2O2 in tea embryos, accompanied by increased
   activities of antioxidant enzymes like ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and
   superoxide dismutase (SOD). Proteomic analyses also demonstrated that 23
   proteins associated with defense response, metabolism and redox status
   were up-regulated following desiccation. Increase in antioxidants,
   ascorbic acid (AsA) and catalase (CAT) (H2O2 scavengers) partially
   assuaged desiccation damage to tea seed, resulting in improved
   germination rates. Higher accumulation of H2O2 aggravated desiccation
   damage to seeds leading to lower germination activity. We propose that
   desiccation causes an over-accumulation of ROS that are not efficiently
   scavenged by increased levels of antioxidant enzymes. High levels of ROS
   alter the redox status and are detrimental to seed viability. Reducing
   ROS to appropriate concentrations is an efficient way to reduce
   desiccation damage and improve germination rates of recalcitrant seeds.

AB MADS-box family transcription factors play essential roles in the growth
   and development of plants, and some MADS-box genes have also been found
   to participate in the stress-response. At present, little information
   regarding stress-related MADS-box genes is available in pepper. We
   isolated a MADS-box transcription factor gene from Capsicum annum, which
   we named CaMADS. CaMADS expression is induced by low and high
   temperature, salt, and osmotic stress, and also by abscisic acid (ABA),
   salicylic acid (SA), methyl-jasmonic acid (MeJA), and CaCl2. To
   understand the function of CaMADS in the abiotic stress response, we
   generated pepper plants in which CaMADS expression was down-regulated
   using VIGS (Virus-induced Gene Silencing), and also transgenic
   Arabidopsis plants overexpressing CaMADS. We found that
   CaMADS-down-regulated seedlings were more seriously injured than WT
   after cold, NaCl, and mannitol treatment, and showed increased
   electrolyte leakage, malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and lower chlorophyll
   content. CaMADS-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants were more tolerant to
   these stresses than WT, and showed significantly high survival rates and
   lower H2O2 and super oxide radical contents after cold treatment.
   CaMADS-overexpressing plants had higher germination rates and
   percentages of green cotyledons following NaCl and mannitol treatment.
   Root lengths and fresh weight in CaMADS-overexpressing plants were also
   significantly longer and higher, respectively, than in WT plants. Taken
   together, our results suggest that CaMADS functions as a positive
   stress-responsive transcription factor in the cold, salt, and osmotic
   stress signaling pathways.

AB Storage behaviour and germination enhancement of Trema cannabina seeds
   (Ulmaceae) were studied. Freshly harvested mature seeds germinated to
   about 70% in 12 weeks at 30/20 degrees C alternating temperatures. Moist
   stratification at 4 degrees C prior to incubation of fresh seeds
   significantly increased germination rate and the mean germination time
   decreased from 53 days to 23 days in 2 months, and to 17 days in 5
   months. Immersing seeds in concentrated sulphuric acid for 80-90 minutes
   significantly increased germination percentage and rate. Seeds of T
   cannabina survived desiccation to both 4.9% and 9.6% moisture contents
   (MC) (fresh weight basis) and storage at 4 and 15 degrees C,
   respectively, for 24 months without a loss of germinability, whereas
   those that were desiccated to 14.4% and 16.2% MC lost their germination
   from 65% to 0-35% under the same storage condition and period. Seeds
   stored at -20 degrees C with 4.9% and 9.6% MC drastically reduced their
   germination from 65% to below 10% in one year and seeds at the same
   subzero temperature with 14.4% or higher MC did not survive in one
   month. Thus, T. cannabina exhibited intermediate seed storage behaviour.

AB Breaking of seed dormancy by moist cold stratification involves complex
   interactions in cells. To assess the effect of moist cold stratification
   on dormancy break in seeds of Acer morrisonense, we monitored
   percentages and rates of germination and changes in plant growth
   regulators, sugars, amino acids and embryo ultrastructure after various
   periods of cold stratification. Fresh seeds incubated at 25/15 degrees C
   for 24 weeks germinated to 61%, while those cold stratified at 5 degrees
   C for 12 weeks germinated to 87% in 1 week. Neither exogenous GA(3) nor
   GA(4) pretreatment significantly increased final seed germination
   percentage. Total ABA content of seeds cold stratified for 12 weeks was
   reduced about 3.3-fold, to a concentration similar to that in germinated
   seeds (radicle emergence). Endogenous GA(3) and GA(7) were detected in
   8-week and 12-week cold stratified seeds but not in fresh seeds.
   Numerous protein and lipid bodies were present in the plumule, first
   true leaves and cotyledons of fresh seeds. Protein and lipid bodies
   decreased greatly during cold stratification, and concentrations of
   total soluble sugars and amino acids increased. The major non-polar
   sugars in fresh seeds were sucrose and fructose, but sucrose increased
   and fructose decreased significantly during cold stratification. The
   major free amino acids were praline and tryptophan in fresh seeds, and
   proline increased and tryptophan decreased during cold stratification.
   Thus, as dormancy break occurs during cold stratification seeds of A.
   morrisonense undergo changes in plant growth regulators, proteins,
   lipids, sugars, amino acids and cell ultrastructure. (C) 2015 Elsevier

AB Freshly harvested seeds of Prunus buergeriana Miq. are dormant and have

   treating seeds with a 500-ppm GA3 solution promoted germination, but the
   mean germination time with the latter was about 40 d longer than that of
   the former, indicating that the germination rate of the latter was slow.
   Concentrations of abscisic<br />acid (ABA) and gibberellins (GAs) were
   measured by GC-MS-SIM in fresh seeds, warm- or cold-stratified seeds,
   and germinating seeds. Fresh seeds contained a higher concentration of
   ABA of 476 ng (g DW)-1, but the concentration of ABA declined to
   20-times lower after warm or cold stratification and was close to that
   of germinating seeds. Cold stratification at 4AAAF increased the
   endogenous GA1, GA3, GA4, and precursor GA20, among which GA1, GA3, and
   GA20 showed greater increases. Warm stratification decreased the ABA
   content of seeds, but the seeds still did not germinate. Cold
   stratification not only decreased the ABA content but also increased the
   GA contents. We concluded that ABA is implicated in the regulation of
   seed dormancy, but the initiation of seed germination is more dependent
   on GAs.

AB The thick cuticle layer, and compact cells and tissues in the pericarp
   of Camptotheca acuminata Decaisne fruit affected water inflow and seed
   germination. After a 4-wk incubation, the germination percentage of
   seeds with pericarp was 15%. However, seed germination increased to 95%
   within 2 wk after the pericarp had been removed. Partial removal of the
   pericarp was able to improve the seed germination, and the highest
   germination was determined when the pericarp near the radicle was
   removed. Cold stratification of fruit at 4degreeC for 3 mo increased
   seed germination to 80% as compared to fresh fruit, and this method
   retained seed viability for 9 mo. Because cold stratification caused the
   pericarp structure to disintegrate, with stratification, there was no
   need to remove the pericarp, and seed germination was promoted. The mean
   germination time was drastically shortened to less than 14 d by a 3-mo
   stratification period. Storing dehydrated fruits of C. acuminata at 4 or
   -20degreeC retained 27% germination, we thus speculated that the seed is
   probably characterized as having an intermediate storage behavior.
   However, this needs to be further confirmed.

AB Objective: Effect of hybrid pollination in different stages on seed
   production in the Hexi corridor in Gansu was studied to provide basis
   for pepper hybrid seed production. Method: Parents of hot pepper F1
   Ganke No. 5 were tested at five stages including early stage, middle
   stage, late stage, last stage and end stage. In each process, 100
   flowers were cross pollinated for 3 times. Daily temperature and
   relative humidity were measured each day and fruit-setting rate, fruit
   maturity, ratio of normal fruit to deformity fruit, amount and yield of
   hybrid seeds per fruit, 1 000-seed weight, seed germination rate and
   germination potential were determined. The relationship between
   environment and fruit traits was also analyzed. Result: At early and
   middle stages, the pollinated fruits grew normally with low rate of
   fruit malformation (10%, 6%), which was 30% for those pollinated at late
   stage and 50% for those pollinated at end stage. In the early, middle,
   late, last and end stage, the pollination fruit-setting rates were 16%,
   76%, 26%, 40% and 10%, respectively. There were two bearing summits in
   middle and last stages, and the fruit-setting rate was intermittent. The
   amount and yield of hybrid seeds per fruit were significantly different
   in different stages, they were low in early stage (16 seeds and 0.125 g
   per fruit) and increased greatly in middle and late stages (69,89 seeds
   and 0.721, 0.938 g per fruit), then they reached the peaks in end stage
   (130 seeds and 1.108 g per fruit) before descending slowly with a
   parabolic curve. The 1 000-seed weights in middle and late stages (10.5
   g) were higher than other stages (8.0-8.5 g). The germination rate of
   seed pollinated in early stage (93.0%) was lower than that in other
   stages (98.0%). Amount and yield of hybrid seeds per fruit and seed
   germination rate had significant positive correlation with minimum
   temperature and the yield of hybrid seeds per fruit and seed germination
   rate had significant positive correlation with average temperature.
   Conclusion: The quality, fruit-setting rate, seed-setting rate, 1
   000-seed weight, and seed germination rate had significant differences
   among treatments pollinated at different stages. Middle and last stages
   were important for hybrid seed production.

AB Objective: The study was to reveal the seed dormancy mechanism of Acer
   yangjuechi and to obtain the effective dormancy-releasing method of
   improving seed germination, so as to improve the breeding efficiency,
   expand population size to mitigate the situation of being extremely
   endangered. Method: Seed development of two different individuals
   growing in National Nature Reserve of Tianmu Mountain, Zhejiang
   province, was tested in 3 successive years. Through cabbage seeds
   germination test, the germination inhabitation of testa, endotesta and
   embryo was conducted. The techniques for seed dormancy releasing were
   studied by treatment of hormone-presoaking or stratification of
   testa-removed seeds at 5°C. Result: Embryo of Acer yangjuechi was poorly
   developed and differs between the two individuals. The average
   percentage of well-developed seeds ranged from 9.73% to 33.98% and the
   average rate of viable seeds was 52.22%. Compared with other Acer
   plants, the lower percentage of well-developed seeds confirmed its high
   infertility rate. The methanol extractant from testa and embryo had the
   higher inhabitation effect on germination than that from endotesta which
   have a high correlation with the content of endogenous ABA. The content
   of endogenous ABA in embryo was the highest one, reaching 1 818.58
   ng.g-1, followed by those in testa with a value of 1 053.34 ng.g-1 and
   endotesta with a value of 859.05 ng.g-1. The complete seeds moist-stored
   at 5°C and testa-removed seeds at room temperature can not germinate
   while the testa-removed seeds germinated and the germination rate
   increased significantly to 30%. And the treatment of presoaking seeds
   with 100 mg.L-1 GA3 or 200 mg.L-1 6-BA for 12 hours promoted seed
   germination rate reaching to 46.67% and 43.33% respectively. The
   duration of seeds-presoaking with hormone had a significant influence on
   germination rate of seeds(P<0.01) while hormone type and concentration
   didn't present significant influence (P>0.05). Conclusion: Seeds of Acer
   yangjuechi often has a high rate of infertility and become empty seeds,
   this is associated with limitation pollen supply. Outcrossing as a
   supplement to self-pollination favors pollination success and embryo
   development. Stands of the species should be planted in small tree-tree
   distance to promote outcrossing which leads to successful reproduction.
   Both forced dormancy by testa and embryo dormancy are existing in the
   seeds of A. yangjuechi. The main inhibitor of seed-germination is the
   endogenous ABA. Low temperature sand stratification of testa-removed
   seeds combined with hormone-presoaking could improve germination rate.
   It is recommended as the method for seed dormancy-releasing. The study
   is of significant implication to population enlargement and sustainable
   conservation of Acer yangjuechi.

AB Objective: The chilling tolerance of bitter gourd was identified and
   evaluated, in order to provide references for screening
   chilling-resistant materials. Method: Under low-temperature conditions,
   the germination potential, seed vigor index, chilling injury index,
   pollen germination rate of seventeen bitter gourd materials were
   determined. Then the chilling-tolerances of seventeen bitter gourd
   materials were ranked based on principal components analysis (PCA) and
   membership function of fuzzy evaluation method, respectively. According
   to ranking result of both methods, seventeen bitter gourd materials were
   clustered to identify and evaluate chilling-tolerance of bitter gourd
   based on principal component values (PCV). membership function values
   (MFV) and original data. Result: The principal component analysis showed
   that, the seed vigor index and chilling injury index for
   chilling-tolerance of bitter gourd had higher load, with coefficients of
   0.795 and 0.923, so they could be used as important indexes for
   identifying chilling-tolerance of bitter gourd. The chilling-tolerances
   of seventeen bitter gourd were classified into six types based on
   membership function value and principal component value. The first type
   was highly sensitive to low temperature, the second type was moderately
   sensitive to low temperature, the third type was lowly sensitive to low
   temperature, the fourth type was chilling-tolerant, the fifth type was
   moderately chilling-tolerant, the sixth type was highly
   chilling-tolerant. Conclusion: The established identification and
   evaluation system of bitter gourd based on PCA and fuzzy evaluation
   method is suitable for evaluating chilling-tolerance of bitter gourd.

AB Dormancy breaking techniques and ultra-structural changes were studied
   in seeds of Sorbus amabilis Cheng ex Yu. Seeds were under different
   treatments including various levels of GA3, NaOH, H2SO4, cold
   stratification and mechanical scarification. The results showed that 90%
   of the seeds of S. amabilis germinated by mechanical scarification and
   cold stratification for a period of 75-90 days, which are effective
   methods to break dormancy. GA3+cold stratification can also break seed
   dormancy, but less effective than treated with directly cold
   stratification. Other treatments could not break seed dormancy.
   Micro-structural characters of seed surface and cotyledon cells were
   observed under scanning and transmission electron microscope in
   different period of cold stratification, the results showed that
   germination rate and dormancy breaking effects are directly related to
   the degree of cuticles broken and disintegration on seed surfaces, and
   directly related to structural changes and deposition degrade in
   cotyledon cells.

   studied in Paeonia ostii 'Feng Dan' to improve the protocol of seedling
   reproduction. Results showed that GA3 treatments with lower
   concentration (100-200 mg . L-1) enhanced the quality of rooting. In a
   certain range, extending the duration of chilling promoted epicotyle
   dormancy release and seedling growth and a proper concentration GA3
   promoted seedling growth and total biomass accumulation, but when the
   chilling days were long enough to release epicotyle dormancy, a higher
   concentration of GA3 was not beneficial to growth. Comprehensive
   analysis on the effects of various treatments on shoot germination rate,
   germination index, seedling height, the first leaf width, leaf number,
   shoot length, shoot and root dry mass within 100 days after seeds were
   treated suggested that 21 and 28 days chilling combined respectively
   with 100 mg . L-1 or 200 mg . L-1 GA3 were beneficial to both seed
   germination and seedling growth, which could be extended into the

TI Autopolyploidy-driven range expansion of a temperate-originated plant to
   pan-tropic under global change
SO Dryad
DI http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/DRYAD.DBRV15F08
PD 2021-01-11
PY 2020
AB Angiosperms are believed to have emerged initially in the tropics and
   expanded their distribution range polewards through diverse mechanisms,
   for example polyploidization-driven cold-tolerance evolution. Reversed
   expansion from temperate to pantropic climate through a
   polyploidization-driven shift in heat-tolerance remains largely unknown.
   Here, we found autopolyploidy in relation to the global expansion of
   Solidago canadensis from its temperate-climate native range in North
   American to hot-summer climate in an introduced range. Our
   cytogeographical study of 2062 accessions from 471 locations worldwide
   demonstrates that ploidy levels correlates negatively with latitude and
   positively with average temperature. An isotherm-dependent shift of the
   climate niches at the threshold of 20-24C between geo-cytotypes can be
   attributed mainly to autopolyploidy-driven differentiation of heat
   tolerance; only polyploids and not diploids are able to complete sexual
   reproduction, germinate and grow in the hot-summer climate of low
   latitudes. Ploidy-dependent fertility appears to play a key role in the
   hot-summer introduced range in the northern hemisphere through both
   pre-adaptation and rapid post-introduction adaptive evolution of delayed
   flowering and improved heat-tolerance during embryo development. MaxEnt
   model predicts continuous expansion of this weed under global change.
   These results provide new insights into the mechanisms governing
   autopolyploidy-driven backward range-expansion of plant species from
   temperate origins. Field sampling We collected seeds and leaf samples
   from up to 21 (median = 5) individuals from 78 locations in the native
   (NA) ranges (64 from the US, 14 from Canada) and 72 locations in the
   introduced (IN) ranges (4 from Japan, 1 from Russia, 3 from Europe, 1
   from India, 63 from China), as well as two fields in China (Lianyungang,
   Jiangsu and Kunming, Yunnan), where the species was cultivated for sale
   as cut flowers (Supporting Information Table S1-3). At each site,
   sampling plots were separated by 10 m to minimize the chance of sampling
   multiple ramets from individual genets. For populations from India and
   40 Chinese populations, leaf samples were collected from plants which
   were generated from field-collected rhizomes grown in a common garden.
   Leaf samples were silica-dried to allow DNA extraction for molecular
   identification of the species (ITS and psbA-trnH sequencing), and seed
   samples were air dried at room temperature prior to experiments.
   Molecular identification To confirm the correct identification of each
   of the 152 collected populations, we sequenced the ribosomal ITS (608bp)
   and psbA-trnH (213bp) intergenic spacer of up to five individuals from
   each population (Table S1, S2). To this end, we extracted total DNA from
   the dried leaves using a Plant Genomic DNA kit (DP305, TIANGEN BIOTECH
   CO., LTD, Beijing, China). The detailed information on primers and PCR
   reaction system and cycle conditions is presented in the Supplementary
   Information. The ribosomal ITS and chloroplast psbA-trnH were sequenced
   and edited using the DNAstar EdiSeq software. As the reference for
   alignment, we extracted the data for S. canadensis (ITS, HQ142590.1;
   psbA-trnH, KX214929.1) from GenBank and aligned them with the ITS and
   psbA-trnH sequences of our samples using the Clustal X 1.83 software.
   The ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2 gene boundaries and psbA-trnH were determined
   from ITS and psbA-trnH sequences of the Solidago genus in GenBank. To
   further verify the species identity of our samples, we conducted a BLAST
   search in the database of the National Center for Biotechnology
   Information (NCBI) to determine the species with the most similar
   identities (Table S1, S2). In addition, we built phylogenetic trees
   (Fig. S1, S2) for our samples with the ITS and psbA-trnH sequences,
   using the MEGA 4.1 Beta 3 software based on the principle of maximum
   parsimony method. We assessed branch support with 2,000 bootstrap
   replicates. Determination of ploidy level First, as a (diploid)
   reference for the ploidy-level determination, we assessed the exact
   chromosome numbers of the progeny from each of the 13 accessions/seed
   families of the Canadian population CA09 (Table S3, Fig. S3a), using
   mitotic root-tip squashes under a microscope. We grew up plants from
   each seed family/accession in the greenhouse, except for the Chinese and
   Indian populations for which field samples of maternal plants were used
   for ploidy examination. Fresh leaf material was held in self-sealing
   plastic bags containing silica and transported to the laboratory for
   ploidy level determination. We applied a modified flow cytometry method
   by Galbraith et al. (1983) for the determination of ploidy level.
   Briefly, 0.5 g fresh leaf tissue was chopped up with a razor blade in 2
   ml of ice-cold Galbraith buffer (PH7.0, 45mM MgCl2, 30mM sodium citrate,
   20mM 4-morpholinepropane sulfonate, 0.5% w/v polyvinylpyrrolidone and
   Triton X-100 1 mg/ml) in a vitreous Petri dish held on a chilled brick.
   The resultant fine slurry was filtered through a 50mum microfilter into
   2 ml polystyrene tubes and incubated at 4 oC for 5min. The final
   filtrate was treated with 10 muL/ml of RNase A for 10 min at 4°C. Then,
   200 muL/ml of a propidium iodide (PI) staining solution was added and
   incubated at 4°C for 30 min in darkness. The fluorescence strength of
   PI-DNA conjugates was measured by flow cytometric (BD FACS, USA) using a
   488 nm laser and 590/40 emission filter (Arumuganathan & Earle 1991).
   The diploid CA09 population (Table S3) was used as an external
   reference. Flow-cytometry data acquisition and analysis was done with
   the software FloMax version 2.0 (Quantum Analysis, Munster, Germany).
   Only histograms with CVs smaller than 10% and with a minimum peak height
   of 50 particles were accepted. Other histograms were discarded and
   corresponding samples were designated no signal (Suda and Travnicek
   2006). To ensure the measurement quality, the external reference
   material (CA09, the fluorescence intensity scale at position 50, Fig.
   S3a) were measured and analyzed at regular intervals in the analysis
   process to verify the corresponding position of the peak of new samples
   that indicates their ploidy levels. Accordingly, each sample was
   identified as diploid (2x), tetraploid (4x) or hexaploid (6x). Based on
   the combination of cytotype (2x/4x/6x) and geographical range (native
   [NA] / introduced [IN]), we assigned each accession to one of the
   following six geo-cytotypes: NA2x, NA4x, NA6x, IN2x, IN4x or IN6x. As
   some of the 152 populations included more than one cytotype, the total
   number of population * cytotype combinations was 233. We also extracted
   data on chromosome numbers of 321 S. canadensis populations with known
   locations from ISI-indexed journals, books and databases of cytological
   indices (Index of Plant Chromosome Numbers [IPCN], International
   Organization of Plant Biosystematics [IOPB] Chromosome Number Reports).
   Detailed information about the published ploidy records are listed in
   Table S4. In total, our study includes information on the 1172 newly
   collected accessions/seed families for which we determined ploidy (Table
   S3) and 890 previously published ploidy records in 471 locations
   worldwide (Table S4). We used these data points to create a
   cytogeographical map in ArcGIS 10.0 (Environmental Systems Research
   Institute, Redlands, California, USA). For each of the 471 locations, we
   extracted the mean July temperature of each sample site using ArcGIS
   10.0. Using the temperature of the hottest month (July) in the northern
   hemisphere, we try to guide the hypothesis that the thermotolerance
   evolution of S. canadensis may occur in populations with different
   ploidy levels. A Tukey test was used to detect differences among the
   different geo-cytotypes separated by the latitude distribution and mean
   July temperature of sample site. To examine whether the latitude
   distribution and mean July temperature were affected by geocytotypes, we
   used two-way ANOVA, with explanatory variables being origin (native,
   introduced), ploidy level (diploid, tetraploid, hexaploid) and their
   interaction. Seed germination at different temperatures Since not all
   150 populations had enough seed, which were collected in field, only 30
   native and 56 introduced cytotype populations representing all
   geo-cytotypes were tested in this experiment (Table S3 E1). We bulked
   the seeds from up to five accessions (if available) from each
   population, and tested their germination under two temperature regimes
   with a temperature of 25°C (12h/12h, day/night) and an extreme
   temperature of 39°C (12h/12h, day/night), respectively (the two
   temperatures were based on Li, 2011). A total of 150 seeds from each
   population were divided into three sets as three replicates. The 50
   seeds were placed on wet filter paper in petri-dish (diameter = 9 cm)
   and kept in the growth chamber (2 m long * 0.8 m wide * 0.8 m high;
   Ningbo Jiangnan Biological Instrument factory, Zhejiang, China). The
   photon flux density was 250 mumol m2 s1, with an 85% relative humidity
   (RH) in the chamber. The germination process was observed every day
   lasted for 15 days, during which the filters were kept wet. Petri-dishes
   were randomly distributed in chambers and their position was changed
   every day. Seeds infected by fungi or bacteria were removed and not
   considered for calculations, but the same number of new seeds were
   added. A seed was considered as germinated if the radicle grew longer
   than seed length. The seed germination inhibition rate was calculated
   using the following equation: Inhibition rate = [(a-b)/a] * 100%, with a
   and b representing mean germination rate of population at 25°C and 39°C.
   One-way ANOVA was used for data analysis with Duncans parametric tests
   being applied to compare the differences of the germination inhibition
   rate among geo-cytotypes. Common garden comparative experiments To
   examine ecological adaptation and reproduction of the different
   geo-cytotypes, two comparative common garden experiments were conducted
   in the introduced range (IRCG) at Nanjing Agricultural University
   (3202′N, 11850′E; Nanjing, Jiangsu, China) and in the native range
   (NRCG) at the University of Georgia (3356′N, 8322′W; Athens, GA, USA),
   respectively. The IRCG experiments started on December 3, 2011 and
   December 5, 2012, while NRCG ones did not begin until December 10, 2012.
   At IRCG, the mean annual rainfall was 1090.7 mm, annual mean temperature
   was 15.6°C, mean max and min temperatures in January were 7.2°C and
   -0.7°C, and mean max and min temperatures in July were 32.2°C and
   24.9°C. A total of 507 accessions propagated from the 30 native and 56
   introduced populations were used in IRCG (population details in Table S3
   E1). At NRCG, mean annual rainfall was 1250.0 mm, annual mean
   temperature was 15.9°C, mean max and min temperatures in January were
   13.9°C and 1.4°C, and mean max and min temperature in July were 32.8°C
   and 20.8°C. A subset of plants from 26 populations, including all
   geo-cytotypes, was grown in NRCG (population details in Table S3 E2). At
   both common gardens, seeds from up to 5 maternal plants of each
   population were germinated in seedling trays filled with a 1:2 mixture
   of soil and sterilized compost in a greenhouse (18-25oC) in December. To
   minimize maternal effects associated with the quality of sampled seeds,
   at least 30-day-old seedlings with similar heights, basal diameters and
   leaf numbers were selected from each maternal plant per population and
   individually transplanted into 11-cm-wide, 8-cm-deep, 1 L plastic pots
   containing the same growing medium. Potted plants were randomly placed
   in a glasshouse supplemented with artificial light for 16 h during the
   day and watered as needed, usually every 2-4 days. Each accession was
   grown individually outdoors in a 5-L plastic pot filled with the same
   growing medium in March (three month after planting, the daily average
   temperature was above 10 oC). Trays and pots were reassigned randomly to
   new positions weekly. Pot management in two common gardens was the same.
   To determine heat and frost tolerance with different geo-cytotypes
   (Table S3 E1), seedlings of S. canadensis accessions were transplanted
   to 1-L plastic pots filled with a 1:2 mixture of soil and sterilized
   compost 30 days (January 2, 2013) after sown in the greenhouse at IRCG.
   Two months later (March 3, 2013), the plants were divided into three
   sets for different experiments. The first set of 516 plants (six
   offspring individuals of 1 to 6 accessions from each population) was
   used to determine the heat tolerance (beginning on March 3, 2013).
   Plants were kept with saturated soil moisture and subjected to 451°C for
   10h in a growth chamber (E-36HO, PERCIVAL, U.S.), and assessed leaf heat
   damage. Seedlings were assessed according to a heat-damage index: 0) for
   healthy and normal seedlings; 1) when the tip of leaves was slightly
   burned; 2) 1-2 leaves were wilted; 3) 3-4 leaves were wilted; 4) > 4
   leaves were wilted; and 5) all leaves wilted. Heat-tolerance index (HI)
   was calculated as 1-Sigma[(number of seedling corresponding grade) / (
   maximum grade total number of seedling)]. The second set of 774 plants
   (nine offspring individuals of 1 to 3 accessions from each population)
   was used to examine physiological responses to high temperature
   (beginning on March 5, 2013). The 3rd to 5th leaves from the shoot apex
   of plant were sampled and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and
   stored at -80°C until use after exposing to 451°C for 0, 2 and 4h,
   respectively (room temperature was about 28°C). The reactive oxygen
   species (ROS) levels (i.e. H2O2 content), activities of antioxidant
   enzymes including Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase activity (Cu/Zn-SOD),
   peroxidase activity (POD), catalase activity (CAT), glutathione
   reductase activity (GR), contents of non-enzymatic antioxidants (ASA),
   and osmoregulatory substances (i.e. soluble proteins) were assayed using
   commercial reagent kits purchased from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering
   Institute (Nanjing, China). The third set of 430 plants (five offspring
   individuals of 1 to 5 accessions from each population) was used to
   estimate freezing tolerance (beginning on March 9, 2013). We examined
   the relative PIABS (performance index on absorption basis) using
   chlorophyll-fluorescence measurements (Pocket-PEA, Hansatech Instruments
   LTD., Kings Lynn, Norfolk, PE32 1JL. UK) (Xie et al. 2015). The initial
   PIABS was measured after 30 min dark adaptation at room temperature. The
   upper, middle and lower parts of both sides of veins in each leaf (the
   fifth mature leaf) were measured. The freezing PIABS was measured at the
   same part of each leaf after the exposure of detached leaves to -8°C for
   30 minutes. The relative PIABS = freezing PIABS/initial PIABS (Xie et
   al. 2015). The relative PIABS represents the freezing tolerance of S.
   canandensis. One-way ANOVA was used to analyze the differences of
   heat-damage index, freezing tolerance (relative PIABS), inhibition rate
   of germination, ROS level, SOD, POD, CAT, GR, ASA, and soluble proteins
   among different geo-cytotypes. Duncans test was applied when assumptions
   of normality and homogeneity of variance were fulfilled; otherwise
   non-parametric ANOVA (Dunnetts C test) would be used. In addition, to
   confirm the effect of environmental temperature factors on plant heat
   tolerance, we used canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) to assess the
   relationship between species factors and environmental factors as
   implemented in CANOCO for Windows 4.5 (Ter Braak & Smilauer 2002). For
   species factors, we included the heat-damage index, ROS level (H2O2
   content) and antioxidative parameters. For environmental factors, we
   included latitude and six bioclimatic variables, including annual mean
   temperature (bio 1), isothermality (bio 3), minimum temperature of
   coldest month (bio 6), mean temperature of driest quarter (bio 9), mean
   temperature of warmest quarter (bio 10) and mean temperature of coldest
   quarter (bio 11). Furthermore, because species factors also were
   significantly affected by ploidy level, we also included ploidy level as
   an environmental factor. To examine reproductive biology, we kept S.
   canadensis plants in both common gardens, with 860 pots of plants
   involved in IRCG (March 30, 2012 and 2013; Table S3 E1) and 260 pots in
   NRCG (April 4, 2013; Table S3 E2). In both common gardens, we assessed
   flowering phenology (onset, peak and end of flowering) and the number of
   viable seeds produced per plant. The latter was based on the number of
   seeds per plant and the germination rate at 25°C for each population
   (the details are described as above). One-way ANOVA was used to analyze
   the data for first flowering dates, flowering duration and number of
   viable seeds among the six geo-cytotypes. Duncans test or Dunnetts C
   test was applied to separate means following the principle described
   above. An additional set of measurements was taken only in IRCG in 2012.
   Because plants from some of native-range North American populations
   failed to produce viable seeds, we tested for pollen viability (Table S3
   E5), stigma receptivity (Table S3 E6), germination rates of pollen
   grains on stigmas (Table S3 E7) and pollen-tube growth (Table S3 E7) for
   these native populations. As S. canadensis is self-incompatible and the
   different cytotypes are not cross-compatible (Yao 2014), we always used
   pollen and stigmas from different plants of the same cytotype in a
   population. We also recorded the mean and maximum daily temperatures
   during embryo development of plants from native populations to assess
   the relationship between embryo development and high temperatures (Table
   S3 E3). To assess the impact of high temperatures on seed sterility more
   accurately, additional measurements were taken also in IRCG in 2014 by
   transferring offspring of 48 maternal plants from 16 populations (Table
   S3 E4) that did not produce viable seeds in IRCG to a climatic chamber
   (Room C3006 in Collage of Life Science, Nanjing Agariculture University)
   with a temperature regime of 24/18°C (12h/12h, day/night, the photon
   flux density was 250 mumol m2 s1) before flowering in July 2014. These
   populations included four NA2x, four NA4x, four NA6x and four IN2x
   populations. In addition, offspring of 24 maternal plants from 4
   populations each of IN4x and IN6x that could produce viable seeds in
   IRCG were also transferred to the climatic chamber with a temperature
   regime of 36/30°C (12h/12h, day/night) before flowering in Oct. 2014
   (Table S3 E4). An identical set of plants that included the above 24
   populations was also prepared and placed outdoors in the common garden
   to serve as controls. The daily management of all experimental plants
   was the same to ensure their normal and comparable growth. Plants
   belonging to the same cytotype and grown under the natural and
   controlled conditions were artificially pollinated with the pollen from
   each other. Seeds per plant were harvested when mature and the number
   and germination rate of well-developed seeds were determined and used to
   estimate the number of viable seeds. Potential distributions of the
   different cytotypes To predict the potential distribution of S.
   canadensis under the current and potential future (2050) climate, based
   on a climate-change scenario, we used MaxEnt climatic niche models
   (Young and Evangelista 2011) and ArcGIS software. For these models, we
   used 5354 occurrence data of S. canadensis, including new data from our
   own research (n=150) (Li 2011, Lu et al. 2020), data from the literature
   (n=321) (Table S4), records downloaded from the Global Biodiversity
   Information Facility (GBIF; n=4784) and additional records from Chinese
   literature (n=101). We used MaxEnt Jackknife tests (test gain > 0.7) to
   select 9 key bioclimatic variables (Elith et al. 2006) out of the 19
   variables available in WorldClim (http://www.worldclim.org) (Table S5,
   Fig. S8). The nine bioclimatic variables are annual mean temperature
   (bio 1), isothermality (bio 3), minimum temperature of coldest month
   (bio 6), mean temperature of driest quarter (bio 9), mean temperature of
   warmest quarter (bio 10), mean temperature of coldest quarter (bio 11),
   precipitation of driest month (bio 14), precipitation of driest quarter
   (bio 17) and precipitation of coldest quarter (bio 19). The WorldClim
   Current Conditions dataset (bioclimatic data averaged across the period
   1950-2000) at a spatial resolution of 10 minutes was used to model the
   current climatic niche of S. canadensis. To forecast the potential
   future suitable ranges for infestation, we used the climate dataset of
   WorldClim for the year 2050 based on the Representative Concentration
   Pathway (RCP) scenario 4.5 (http://tntcat.iiasa.ac.at:8787/RcpDb). It is
   a moderate scenario where the total radiative forcing stabilizes before
   2100 (Dyderski et al. 2018). For the predictions of the climatic niche
   modelling, occurrence data for S. canadensis was randomly divided
   according to the algorithms of the MaxEnt software into training data
   (75% of occurrence points) for model prediction and test data (25% of
   occurrence points) for model validation. All additional parameters were
   set to their default values. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC)
   curve plot was built, and the scores of the area under the curve (AUC)
   indicated a good (AUC values at 0.8-0.9) to excellent (AUC values of
   0.9-1.0) model fit (Fig. S9). The forecasted climatic suitability of
   different areas around the globe was classified into five categories
   using natural segmentation method based on clustering analysis in ArcGIS
   software: unsuitable (0-0.2327), low suitable (0.2327-0.5), margin
   suitable (0.5-0.6), suitable (0.6-0.7) and high risky suitable (0.7-1.0)
   (Kigen et al. 2019). Supporting InformationMaterials and Methods
   Molecular identification A pair of primers (upstream:
   5'-CGTAACAAGGTTTCCGTAG-3', downstream: 5'-TTATTGATATGCTT
   AAACTCAGCGGG-3') were used to amplify ITS rDNA gene and another pair of
   primers (upstream: 5-CCGCCCCTCTACTATTATCTA-3, downstream:
   5-TCTAGACTTAGCAGCTATTG-3) were used to amplify psbA-trnH intergenic
   spacer. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out in 50muL
   containing 2muL of 10mumol/L primers, 10*buffer 5muL, 25mM Mg2+ 4muL,
   2.5mmol/L dNTPs 4muL, 50ng/muL DNA templates1muL and 5U Taq DNA
   polymerase 0.5muL. The PCR cycle was 95°C for 4 min followed by 30
   cycles of 95°C for 30s, 52°C for 60s, 72°C for 60s, and a final
   extension step at 72°C for 7 min. PCR products were separated on 1%
   agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide. The PCR products were
   purified and sequenced. Common garden sites and materials Two pot common
   garden greenhouse pot experiments were established at Nanjing
   Agricultural University [Nanjing, Jiangsu, China (322N, 11850E),
   December 2011] and University of Georgia [Athens, GA, USA (3356N,
   8322W), December 2012]. Seeds from all maternal plants of 86 populations
   were germinated in seedling trays filled with 1:2 mixture of soil and
   sterilized compost in the introduced common garden. For all of the
   populations at least five individual plants were originally collected
   each sampling plot but a few populations only included less than five
   individuals each cytotype through detection of ploidy. The populations
   with less individuals, all characterized according to cytotype by
   detection of their ploidy, were considered in the experiment and their
   lesser number did not significantly affect the obtained results
   according to statistical tests (Supporting Data 1). Measurement of
   physiological and biochemical characteristics associated with seedling
   thermotolerance. The activity of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD,
   EC.1.15.1.1) was measured by test Kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering
   Institute, China; A001-4). The activity of peroxidase (POD, EC 1.11.1.7)
   was .measured by Guaiacol method (Li et al. 2013). Catalase activity
   (CAT, EC.1.11.1.6) was .measured by test Kit (Nanjing Jiancheng
   Bioengineering Institute, China; A007-1-1) (Yong et al. 2008).
   Glutathione reductase (GR, EC.1.6.4.2) was measured by test Kit (Nanjing
   Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, China; A062-1-1) (Li et al. 2017).
   Protein content was detected by the method of coomassie brilliant blue
   (Deng 2013). The H2O2 concentration was detected by monitoring the
   absorbance of the titanium- peroxide complex at 415 nm, following the
   method of Patterson (Brennan & Frenkel 1977). Reproductive traits Growth
   of all potted plants was regularly monitored in both the native and
   introduced common gardens. Flowering phenology was assessed after onset
   of flowering (first flower head open), peak flowering (>50% flower head
   open) and end of flowering (>50% flower heads closed); in each plant
   flowering dynamics was recorded for every shoot (capitulescence) at 3-d
   intervals. The duration of flowering per plant (days between onset and
   end of flowering) was determined. Infructescences of all flowering
   individuals were bagged before seeds matured and dispersed. After seed
   matured, infructescences per plant were harvested, dried naturally and
   weighed. The number of seeds of each plant was estimated from the
   average 500-seed weight of five samples per population. The number of
   viable seeds was estimated by the number of seeds and the germination
   rate at 25°C per population. Five individuals per population were
   recorded and measured (Table S3 E1, E4). Cross-compatibility experiments
   A group of seedlings representative of the six geo-cytotypes was sown
   every 40 days (beginning Jan. 15, 2012) to ensure synchrony of their
   flowering periods. Two plants matching in flowering period from the six
   geo-cytotypes were selected at the early flowering stage for reciprocal
   crossings. The positive and reverse crosses were made in all possible
   combinations between paired individuals belonging to the six different
   geo-cytotypes (three each from native and introduced ranges). Three
   populations were selected from each cytotype except for single
   introduced diploid (Table S3 E7). For each cross, three individual
   plants from each population were used; each one was considered a
   replication. Additionally, two kinds of artificial self-pollinations
   were defined as controls: those of different individuals within each
   cytotype and those of different florets of same individual.The same
   procedure was used to select the individuals for artificial
   self-pollination.For same individual, artificial self-pollinations were
   made between different clonal shoots from a maternal plant, different
   capitula on the same shoot and different tubular florets within a single
   capitulum. The bisexual tubular florets in the capitulum were carefully
   removed and the emasculation capitula were isolated with paper bags.
   After 5-7 days, plants were artificially pollinated when the stigma of
   ligulate flowers grew out of the petals and showed a Y shape. The pollen
   of selected male parents was collected with a brush and applied to the
   column head of the emasculation female parent and the paper bags were
   replaced quickly after pollination. Capitula were collected at 1h, 2h,
   4h, 8h, 24h, 48h, and 72h after pollination (Fig. S5d), and thereafter
   gathered every 3 days, fixed with Carlo fixation liquid for further
   observation of pollen tube growth and embryo development. The mature
   seeds from each cross-combination were carefully harvested and their
   germination was tested at 25°C. At the full-bloom stage of the S.
   candensis, six capitula from each of five populations per geo-cytotype
   were selected to determine their pollen vitality with the benzidine
   method (King 1960) (Table S3 E5). Briefly, new blooming capitula,
   collected between 9:00 and 11:00hrs in a sunny day, were placed into
   concave slides, followed by the addition of reagent I (0.5% biphenyl
   10ml, 0.5% alpha naphthol 10ml, 0.25% sodium carbonate 10ml) and 0.3%
   hydrogen peroxide. Capitula were mashed and the mixture was transferred
   into a 1.5ml centrifuge tube and incubated for 50 min at 30°C. Stained
   pollen grains were observed and photographed with a microscope (Olympus
   BX53). Vigorous pollen grains stained black while the undynamic pollen
   grains stained yellow. Ten visual fields of each slide were randomly
   selected for assessment. To determine stigma receptivity, capitula were
   also collected as described before (Table S3 E6). The florets were
   placed into concave slides, followed by the addition of the staining
   benzidine-hydrogen peroxide solution (1% benzidine: 3% hydrogen
   peroxide: H2O = 4:11:55 volume ratio), and observed under the same
   microscope. Vigorous stigma stained blue and produced a large number of
   bubbles. Nine florets per geo-cytotype were observed and counted.
   Additional capitula were soaked in 70% ethanol for 30 min and for
   additional 30 min in 90% ethanol after fixation with Carnoy's fluid for
   at least 24 hour. Then, the capitula were preserved in 70% ethanol.
   Before observation, capitula were rehydrated sequentially in 50%, 30%,
   10% ethanol and distilled water for ten min each, softened in 6 mol/L
   NaOH for eight hours, washed three times with distilled water and
   stained with 0.1% aniline blue for 12 hours. The number of pollen grains
   germinating on the stigma and pollen tubes growing into the ovary were
   counted under the fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss, Axio Observer
   Z1), after making microscopic slides of tissue samples. Thirty single
   flowers of each cross combination were observed and counted. After
   artificial pollination, capitula were sampled and fixed in
   formalin-acetic acid-alcohol (Berlyn & Miksche 1976) (FAA) at different
   embryonic developmental stages. Before observation, capitula were
   immersed orderly in 50% alcohol, 30% alcohol, 10% alcohol and distilled
   water every ten min. Individual flowers were carefully separated from
   capitula with forceps and immersed and softened in 2.5 mol·L-1 NaOH
   solution for six hours, and washed three times with distilled water. The
   single flowers were carefully placed on a slide and stained by aniline
   blue - lactic acid - phenol dye solution (Hu 1994) for five min. Before
   dropping 40% glycerol on individual flowers, redundant dye solution was
   absorbed by filter paper. Single flowers were covered with slide cover
   slips. The number of normal embryos at the different development stages
   was counted under the light microscope (Olympus BX53) (Table S3 E3). The
   normal development and abortion process of embryo is illustrated in Fig.
   S6: After pollination, the developing proembryo could be observed within
   24 hours, globular embryos, the spherical embryo formed in 3~5 days
   after pollination (DAP), the heart-shaped embryo formed in 6~8 DAP, the
   torpedo-shaped embryo formed in 20~25 DAP and gradually matured.
   However, in the case of the following, we considered to be abnormal: 1,
   the development of embryos is seriously lagging. 2, the periphery of the
   embryo is transparent and the embryo atrophy or cluster. 3, the embryo
   is severely atrophied and only some small irregular clusters can be
   observed inside the peel. 4, only pericarp, no embryos and clusters can
   be observed inside the peel. Prediction of potential geographical
   distribution of S. canadensis Occurrence data We searched published
   information on chromosome numbers of S. canadensis in relation to
   location in ISI-indexed journals, books and in cytological indices
   [Index of Plant Chromosome Numbers (IPCN); International Organization of
   Plant Biosystematics (IOPB) Chromosome Number Reports] (Table S4) and
   sampled wild populations in the native and introduced range (Table S3).
   Environmental variables, isotherms and processing of environmental data
   The Current Conditions (Current Conditions 1950~2000) bioclimatic
   dataset was used to extract the current ecological niche of S.
   canadensis. For simulation of the future suitable region, we used the
   future climate dataset in the RCP4.5 scenarios
   (http://tntcat.iiasa.ac.at:8787/RcpDb) provided by the Coupled Model
   Intercomparison Project (CMIP). The RCP 4.5 is developed by the MiniCAM
   modeling team at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory's Joint
   Global Change Research Institute (JGCRI). It is a stabilization scenario
   where total radiative forcing is stabilized before 2100 by employment of
   a range of technologies and strategies for reducing greenhouse gas
   emissions and has a higher priority. We simulated the distribution of
   suitable region in the future climate change scenarios based on the
   current ecological niche of S. canadensis. The future climate dataset of
   RCP4.5 was used to drive the ecological niche modeling, before that it
   should be treated with the following: (1) the value of each
   environmental variable corresponding to all records in the current
   climate data layer was extracted by the spatial data processing tools of
   ArcGIS, (2) the value was assigned a value of background pixels at
   corresponding position in the future climate data layer. Data processing
   Occurrence data of S. canadensis was randomly divided according to the
   algorithms of the software (MaxEnt) itself into training data (75% of
   occurrence point data used for model prediction) and test data (25% of
   occurrence point data used for model validation) with all additional
   parameters set as default. A receiver operating characteristics curve
   (ROC) plot was built by plotting the sensitivity values and the false
   positive fraction for all available probability thresholds (Manel et al.
   2001) (Fig. S9). The area under the curve (AUC) was a measure of the
   area under the ROC, ranging from 0.5 to 1.0. The higher the AUC score,
   the better the model is at predicting presence/absence, indicating the
   environmental variables have high correlation with the predicted
   distribution of species, and prediction of the model is of high
   validity. The predicted model can be invalid (AUC value is lower than
   0.6), poor (AUC value is 0.6-0.7), fair (AUC value is 0.7-0.8), good
   (AUC value is 0.8-0.9) and excellent (AUC value is 0.9-1.0) (Swets
   1988). Using a heuristic estimation during training of the model and by
   means of a jackknife test, the importance of each environmental variable
   in the model was evaluated (Fig. S8). The model was visually exhibited
   in ArcGis (version 10.0) to produce a single final distribution map.
   Different map colors corresponded to different fitting indices in the
   potential distribution map. The analysis base map was obtained from the
   National Fundamental Geographic Information System
   (http://nfgis.nsdi.gov.cn/). There are some missing values in the
   dataset: 1.)Six missing valueswill be finded inantioxidative parameters
   of cytotypes among native and invasive S. canadensis after heat exposure
   (45 C for 0, 2 and 4 h respectively) （File: Heat_tolerance.xlsx，Sheet:

AB Many of the world's important crops such as soybean are now widely
   distributed, beyond their original zones of natural selection and
   chilling temperature is one of the major abiotic environmental factors
   which limit their growth and yield. Various molecular mechanisms,
   underlying chilling stress and plant responses are yet to be discovered.
   Chilling temperatures impart maximum damage to the soybean seeds, sown
   in wet soils, during imbibition, causing poor germination rate, reduced
   seedling emergence, decreased seedling vigor, and ultimately severe loss
   in yield. Here we report the changes in proteome of soybean seeds
   exposed to low temperature (4A degrees C) during imbibition in a known
   chilling-resistant soybean cultivar Z22, using two-dimensional gel
   electrophoresis (2-DE) and Matrix-Assisted Laser Ionization Time of
   Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS). Total 40 protein spots were
   differentially expressed in response to low temperature, in which, 25
   protein spots were up-regulated and fifteen protein spots were
   down-regulated. According to the search in primary databases, these
   proteins were a part of many metabolic pathways including, cell defense,
   energy, protein synthesis, cell growth/division, storage, transcription
   and transport. To investigate the change in mRNA levels during
   imbibition at 4A degrees C, quantitative RT-PCR of nine up-regulated
   protein genes was carried out, which clearly demonstrated an increase in
   the transcript levels of five genes, whereas no change was observed for
   other four genes. Results of this study provide some invaluable insights
   about the response of soybean seeds to low temperature imbibition which
   include; (1) alcohol dehydrogenase I and RAB21 might contribute in
   decreasing the effect of anoxia, resulting from water up-take during
   imbibition, (2) stress-related proteins such as LEA and GST24 probably
   played a pivotal role in confronting low temperature stress and (3)
   expression of some crucial enzymes (malate dehydrogenase and
   phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase) involved in TCA cycle was enhanced,
   which might be beneficial for seeds, in stress conditions during
   germination.

AB We examined the effectiveness of seed selection based on the specific
   gravity of water and the duration of moist chilling treatment required
   to break seed dormancy in Abies mariesii. The proportion of filled seeds
   significantly increased 74.7-84.7% after specific gravity-based
   selection using water compared to the proportion of untreated seeds
   (28.7%). Therefore, our study indicates that seed selection using
   specific gravity of water can easily improve the seed filling rate of
   Abies mariesii. The germination rate between seeds in the moist chilling
   treatment and non-treatment were compared. The results showed that the
   germination rate of the former was 75.0-84.7%, which was significantly
   higher than the latter (18.3%). The duration of the moist chilling
   treatment showed no statistical difference in the final germination
   rate, and more than 70% of the seeds germinated even after 30 days of
   moist chilling treatment.

AB The Onagraceae are a well-defined family of flowering plants much used
   by man. Many representatives of this group, which contains 75 species
   belonging to 8 genera, are indigenous to Argentina, and 19% of these are
   commonly found throughout the country. Many Onagraceae are ruderal and
   promote the subsequent establishment of other species, thus contributing
   to the restoration of degraded areas. Since it is important to know the
   characteristics of seeds to be used in restoration projects, we studied
   the basic germination physiology of Oenothera odorata Jacq., a ruderal
   plant indigenous to Argentina. Material was collected from roadsides and
   embankments along National Highway 40 in the municipality of San Carlos
   de Bariloche, which lies within the Patagonian phytogeographical
   Province. Road construction generates degraded areas where O. odorata
   could be used to initiate revegetation and consolidate the substrate. We
   evaluated percentage germination (G), mean germination time (MGT) and
   time until initiation of germination (TUG) of a control (C) and of the
   following pre-germination treatments: 45 days cold moist stratification
   (CMS) and mechanical scarification with a scalpel (MS). Germination
   percentages were high (98% CMS, 96% MS, 93% C), with differences
   recorded only between CMS and C. MGT was lower in the CMS treatment than
   the control, but similar to MS. TUG was 4 days for all treatments. In
   conclusion, this species lacks dormancy mechanisms under these
   experimental conditions, which, together with the fact that it grows in
   disturbed sites, is endemic, and captures heavy metals, makes it
   suitable for use in the ecological restoration of areas affected by
   transport systems.

   minutes significantly increased germination percentage and rate.
   Seeds<br />of T. cannabina survived desiccation to both 4.9% and 9.6%
   moisture contents (MC) (fresh weight basis) and<br />storage at 4 and
   15A°C, respectively, for 24 months without a loss of germinability,
   whereas those that were<br />desiccated to 14.4% and 16.2% MC lost their
   germination from 65% to 0-35% under the same storage condition<br />and
   period. Seeds stored at -20A°C with 4.9% and 9.6% MC drastically reduced
   their germination from 65% to<br />below 10% in one year and seeds at
   the same subzero temperature with 14.4% or higher MC did not survive
   in<br />one month. Thus, T. cannabina exhibited intermediate seed
   storage behaviour.

AB In this study, we show that seeds of Ilex maximowicziana collected from
   northern and southern Taiwan differ in germination responses to
   temperature. Seeds produced by plants growing in the tropical
   environment of southern Taiwan were more responsive (in a positive way)
   to higher incubation temperatures than those produced by plants growing
   in the subtropical environment of northern Taiwan. On the other hand,
   seeds produced in northern Taiwan were more responsive (in a positive
   way) to low incubation temperatures and to cold stratification than
   those from southern Taiwan. Germination percentages and rates of seeds
   from northern Taiwan were higher at 20/10A degrees C than at 30/20A
   degrees C, reaching a plateau of > 80% germination after 12 weeks
   incubation, whereas germination of seeds from southern Taiwan reached >
   80% at 30/20 and 25A degrees C but not at 20/10A degrees C. Gibberellic
   acid (GA(3)) increased germination rate but not germination percentage
   of seeds from both southern and northern Taiwan. Freshly matured seeds
   of I. maximowicziana have rudimentary embryos. During dormancy break,
   embryo length increased 11.5- and 8.0-fold in northern and southern
   seeds, respectively, before radicle emergence. Thus, seeds of Ilex
   maximowicziana have nondeep simple morphophysiological dormancy. This is
   the first detailed study of the germination requirements of a
   subtropical/tropical species of the large cosmopolitan genus Ilex.

AB Seed storage behavior of Lindera communis, L. megaphylla, and Phoebe
   formosana representing the Lauraceae, and Helicia cochinchinensis, and
   H. formosana representing the Proteaceae were studied. Effect of cold
   storage in moist sphagnum on retaining viability was also investigated
   for seeds of the 5 species. Seeds of the 5 species were dehydrated to
   various water contents, and stored at -20, 4, and 15degreeC for 1 y.
   Water contents of freshly harvested L. communis and L. megaphylla seeds
   were 50.2 and 33.5%, and germination percentages were 38.5 and 100%,
   respectively. When seeds of the 2 species were dried to water contents
   of 9-11%, their viability was maintained at 75% or greater of the
   original germination percentages. However, the seed viability decreased
   with an increase in storage time. The germination percentage decreased
   to 30% of the initial germination under 4degreeC storage for 3 months
   and decreased to nil at 6 months. Seeds stored at 15degreeC were not as
   good as those at 4degreeC, and all of those stored at -20degree C were
   dead. Thus, the partial desiccation tolerance and freezing sensitivity
   of L. communis and L. megaphylla seeds are recognized as intermediate
   storage behavior. After further comparison with other species of the
   intermediate type, we believe that their properties lie between the
   intermediate and recalcitrant types due to their shorter effective
   storage period. Seeds of P. formosana, H. cochinchinensis and H.
   formosana were sensitive to desiccation and are characterized as having
   recalcitrant storage behavior. Seeds of the 5 species were capable of
   being stored for 6 to 24 months depending on species at moist-chilled
   temperature of 4degreeC with moist sphagnum, and mean germination time
   also gradually shortened following storage time.

AB Seeds of Prunus campanulata are known for their morphological and
   physiological dormancy which can be broken by a combination of warm and
   cold stratification. This treatment is usually applied after storage and
   before sowing. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness
   of dormancy-breaking treatment before storage of Prunus campanulata
   seeds. Two treatment procedures were proposed. The first one involved
   warm stratification of freshly collected seeds at 30/20degreeC or
   25/15degreeC for 6 wk, followed by drying to 3 moisture contents
   (4.8-5.3%, 11.6-11.8% and 16.3-17.1%) and storage at -20degreeC or
   5degreeC for 3-12 mo. Stored seeds were mixed with sphagnum and
   stratified at 5degreeC for 8 wk before germination test. The second one
   involved warm stratification at 30/20degreeC for 6 wk followed by cold
   stratification at 5degreeC for 8 wk for dormancy breaking, and then
   drying to 2 seed moisture contents (5.2 and 16.3%) for storage at
   -20degreeC or 5degreeC for 3-12 mo. Stored seeds were tested directly
   for germination. Evaluation criteria used were the germination
   percentage and mean germination time (MGT). The result showed that seeds
   stored at -20degreeC or 5degreeC for 12 mo maintained 70% germination or
   above with the 2 treatment procedures. However, the first treatment
   procedure reduced MGT and enhanced the uniformity of germination. A
   possible cause for the reduced seed germination percentage during
   storage is discussed.

AB Seeds of Taxus mairei are known for their deep dormancy which can only
   be broken by a procedure involving warm stratification followed by cold
   stratification. Treatments with alternating temperatures of 25/15 or
   23/11 degrees C (12 h light) for 6 months followed by 5 degrees C for 3
   months were successful in overcoming seed dormancy. After 6 months of
   warm stratification, cytological changes observed included: enlargement
   of the embryo; a decrease in the number of lipid bodies; appearance of
   ER; and increases in mitochondria, plastids, dictyosomes, vacuoles and
   microbodies in the shoot apical meristem. Cold stratification following
   the warm treatment induced cell division, and one or two distinct
   nucleoli in the shoot apical meristem cells were observed. Both warm and
   cold stratification reduced endogenous ABA concentrations from the
   original 8888 pg per freshly harvested seed to 392 and 536 pg,
   respectively. Treatment with exogenous gibberellins after seeds had been
   warm-stratified showed that GA(4) and GA(7) were effective at promoting
   seed germination, but GA(3) was not. These results suggest that the
   strong seed dormancy of T. mairei could be caused by a high ABA content
   and underdevelopment of the embryos in freshly shed seeds. We conclude
   that warm stratification with alternating temperatures increases the
   growth of embryos by cell expansion acid enlargement and decreases ABA
   content, but seeds still remain ungerminated Cold stratification may
   induce the response to GAs and initiate cell division resulting in
   release from physiological dormancy and subsequent germination of T.
   mairei seeds. (C) 1998 Annals of Botany Company.

AB In this study, the biocontrol agent, Trichoderma asperellum, was
   bioprimed onto chilli seeds using several biopolymers (sodium alginate,
   carboxymethylcellulose, gum arabic, xanthan gum). T. asperellum showed >
   60 % growth inhibition towards Fusarium solani and Pythium ultimum, and
   is used subsequently for all tests. The compatibility of biopolymers to
   seed and T. asperellum, and the performance of the bioprimed seeds in
   tolerating disease is then assessed. Results showed that 1.5 % w:v
   sodium alginate (SA1.5) (imbibed for 1 h) has the highest compatibility
   with chilli seeds, with percentage of germination at 77.78 +/- 4.44 %,
   seed vigour index at 320.79 +/- 58.14 and germination rate at 1.27 +/-
   0.06. This treatment (SA1.5) also resulted in high coating efficacy,
   retaining 83.17 % of viable spores on chilli seeds and maintaining spore
   viability (4.08 +/- 0.03 log spore/seed) after 24 h post-biopriming. SEM
   observations revealed high distribution of spores on chilli seeds with
   the use of SA1.5. With a treatment of just 102 spores/mL, the bioprimed
   seeds were able to suppress disease severity (DS) by F. solani in potted
   trials (27.33 +/- 4.04 % DS). This is attributed to mycoparasitic
   properties of T. asperellum. Under F. solani infection, low proline
   level was recorded in bioprimed seedlings (0.94 +/- 0.01 mu mol/g fr.
   wt.) compared to non-bioprimed seedlings (5.05 +/- 0.13 mu mol/g fr.
   wt.), suggesting T. asperellum protected seedlings from pathogen. By
   contrast, the formulation of T. asperellum was less effective towards P.
   ultimum, as relatively high proline level (3.37 +/- 0.05 mu mol/g fr.
   wt.) and a lower total phenolic content (99.61 +/- 4.29 mg GAE/100 g fr.
   wt.) were recorded. To conclude, our results revealed the compatibility
   of biopolymers, specifically sodium alginate with chilli seeds and T.
   asperellum, leading to enhanced efficacy in seed biopriming and seed
   tolerance to infection by F. solani.

AB Introduction: Invasive fungus Cryphonectria parasitica has produced the
   mass dieback of the American and sweet chestnut forests, destroying
   their habitats, till the extinction level of the species in some areas.
   The conservation status of the sweet chestnut (as a species) and its
   habitat 9260 - Woods with Castanea sativa in Tismana area (as well as in
   the whole Romania) was unfavourable. The fungus has killed or highly
   restructured all the mature (fruiting) sweet chestnut stands. During the
   dieback process, the sweet chestnut was completely eliminated from many
   stands due to the competition of European beech and European hornbeam.
   The rehabilitation of sweet chestnut habitat includes the biological
   control of the invasive pathogen and the (natural and artificial)
   regeneration of chestnut. Limitative factors of the chestnut culture are
   the lower production of chestnuts in dead/dying stands due to C.
   parasitica, low germination of chestnuts in traditionally forest nursery
   cultures, nursery infections with Phytophthora sp. and dependence of the
   planted bare-root seedling survival on (spring) weather conditions. The
   aim of this research was to improve the methodology of sweet chestnut
   artificial regeneration in the Romanian silviculture. The objectives
   were to increase the germination rate of chestnuts and to obtain a
   better survival of the chestnut seedlings in plantations. Materials and
   methods: The following treatments were used for seed germination: (i)
   seed stratification in winter time (deep in nursery sandy soil) and
   seeding in greenhouse conditions, in plastic pots with peat/sand/soil
   mixture (location: greenhouse in Brasov, period: spring of 2017 and
   2018, 4 replications/year); (ii) direct nut seeding (soon after harvest)
   in soil (control) (location: forest nurseries in Tismana, period:
   2013-2018, period: 2013, 2015-2018, 4 replications/year). For seedling
   production, the treatments were: (iii) chestnut seedling growing in
   greenhouse conditions (period: 2017-2018, 4 replications/year); (iv)
   seedling growing in forest nurseries (4 replications/year, period: 2013,
   2015-2018) and for seedling plantation the treatments were: (v) planting
   the potted seedlings from the greenhouse (location: forests of Tismana
   zone, period: 2017-2018, 4 replications/year); (vi) plantation of
   bare-root seedlings obtained in the forest nurseries (location: forests
   of Tismana zone, period: 2015-2018, 4 replications/year). Results and
   discussion: Chestnut stratification (in soil, in sandy layers) during
   the winter has led to obtaining more than double germination rates
   compared to the traditional method (direct autumn seeding). Survival
   rate in the first year of culture was similar to the chestnut seedlings
   produced in greenhouse conditions (seeded in pots in peat, sand and soil
   mixture) and in the nursery field (seeded in soil). Survival rate of the
   chestnut seedlings in the first year after planting in the forest was
   with 29% to 41% higher on potted seedlings comparing to bare-root
   seedlings in dry and hot seasons (2015, 2017, 2018, which were the
   hottest years in Romanian meteorological history), while in the rainy
   periods (2016) the survival rate of the bare-rooted seedlings was very
   good. Conclusion: Tested methods of nut stratification during winter,
   seedling production in greenhouses and potted seedling plantation in
   forest condition offer better chances to obtain larger and constant
   seedling production (vital for rehabilitation of chestnut forests
   affected by Cryphonectria parastica) and more stable plantations
   (especially under drought stress) compared to classical forestry
   methods.

AB Seeds were segregated by flotation in water and 96% ethanol into: full
   (sinking in water); half full (floating in water and sinking in
   ethanol); and empty (floating in water and ethanol). Dormancy of full
   and half full seeds was best overcome by warm-followed-by-cold
   stratification with a 4-wk warm phase at 20°C followed by a cold phase
   at 3°C up to the onset of germination (about 20-23 wk). Germination of
   stratified seeds was highest at an alternating 3/20°C on a 16+8 h cycle
   (most germinated in 2-5 wk) or at a constant 3°C (most germinated in
   8-12 wk). Ethanol had no effect on germination rate when optimum
   stratification and germination conditions were used. Only about 50% of

AB We investigated the sensitivity of dormant Polish-provenance Fraxinus
   excelsior L. seeds to extreme desiccation and liquid nitrogen (LN, -196
   degrees C). Germination and seedling emergence tests revealed that the
   critical water content (WC) of the desiccated seeds was 0.04-0.06 g H2O
   g(-1) dry mass, g g(-1) (0.04 g g(-1) in the germination test and 0.06 g
   g(-1) in the seedling emergence test). The seeds that were within the
   safe WC range (0.06-0.24 g g(-1) in the germination test and 0.08-0.24 g
   g(-1) in the seedling emergence test) tolerated freezing in LN. A 2-year
   seed storage period in LN after desiccation to a safe WC did not
   decrease the germination after thawing as compared with a 2-year seed
   storage at -3 degrees C. When the seeds were stored in LN after dormancy
   breaking, the germination rate after storage was lower, because the
   seeds had to be desiccated to the lower level (similar to 0.11 g g(-1))
   within the seeds' safe WC range after stratification (before storage).
   Secondary dormancy was induced in seeds that were desiccated after
   stratification. The results of this study confirm the feasibility of
   long-term cryopreservation of European ash seeds in forest gene banks.

AB Abies koreana is an endemic and endangered species in Korea. To
   understand the seed germination characteristics of A. koreana,
   germination response was examined under different cold stratification
   periods, temperature conditions, and drought regimes with comparison to
   Abies sachalinensis, seedlings of which occur densely in natural forests
   in Hokkaido, Japan. Cold stratification of 30-150 days increased the
   germination speed and final germination rate in both species. In seeds
   with the cold stratification of 150 days, final germination rates at
   10-30°C were 1.7-8.5 (42.9-87.8%) and 2.1-9.2 (72.1-89.8%) times those
   of unstratified seeds in A. koreana and A. sachalinensis, respectively.
   However, A. koreana seeds germinated more slowly than A. sachalinensis
   seeds, and took about 40 days to reach the final germination rates at
   10-30°C. Increase in germination rates of A. koreana depended on cold
   stratification periods and temperature conditions of the germination
   test. Cold stratification especially increased the germination rate
   under cold temperature conditions. Longer cold stratification was
   necessary for A. koreana compared with A. sachalinensis. Cold stratified
   seeds of the two species were not affected in germination rates by a
   non-watered condition of 6 days. However, the germination rates of cold
   stratified seeds of A. koreana decreased significantly with decreased
   water potential adjusted by polyethylene glycol 6, 000 solutions, and
   declined to approximately 50% of control seeds at -0.4 MPa of water
   potential. In contrast, cold stratified seeds of A. sachalinensis were
   germinated to approximately 80% of control seeds at -0.8 MPa of water
   potential. Consequently, it is assumed that the germination period of A.
   koreana seeds is longer than that of A. sachalinensis so it is easy for
   A. koreana seeds to avoid damage such as late frost injury, although its
   drought tolerance is weaker than that of A. sachalinensis.

AB Information on seed dormancy is one of the primary requirements for
   successful seedling propagation of submerged aquatics and seagrass.
   Studies on Ruppia maritima seed germination have been done, but the
   presence, requirements, and the types of dormancy have not been well
   understood. A laboratory study was conducted to understand presence and
   types of organic dormancy of the seeds of estuarine R. maritima
   collected from Lake Pontchartrain, Louisiana, USA. Our study results
   indicate that the brackish estuarine R. maritima population produces
   seeds that do not have any noticeable initial morphological, physical,
   and physiological dormancy. Although dry stratification reduced seed
   viability and final germination rates, drying seems to induce an earlier
   germination in R. maritima. Desiccation also appears to induce an
   environmental dormancy that can be disrupted by exposure to water.
   Further study on environmental dormancy is needed to provide information
   to develop methods for long-term seed storage that can be employed in
   greenhouse seedling propagation.

AB Cicuta virosa L. has significant medicinal, ecological, and research
   potential, however there is little research history about seed dormancy.
   We characterized morphological changes during the embryo maturation
   stages of C. virosa L. seeds to better understand its dormancy type and
   germination characteristics, which is necessary for optimizing seed
   propagation. In addition, water absorption measurements, germination
   tests, cold moist stratification, and GA(3) or kinetin were used to
   determine dormancy and germination characteristics. C. virosa seed
   dormancy presents a morphophysiological dormancy (MPD) with an
   undeveloped embryo. Since cold moist stratification at 4 A degrees C
   caused the embryo to develop and the radicle to break through seed coat,
   its dormancy was determined to be of a non-deep complex type. For
   dormancy-broken seeds, the optimal germination condition was incubation
   at 25 A degrees C in the light, with a pretreatment of GA(3) and
   kinetin. Indeed, GA(3) improved the germination rate up to 90%
   regardless of its concentration, and kinetin at least doubled the
   germination rate of C. virosa seeds compared to that of the controls.
   Additionally, KNO3 improved germination rates by 50% with respect to
   that of the controls regardless of the concentration at which it was
   added. Our results indicate that C. virosa seeds have MPD and can be
   planted consistently en masse with cold stratification, GA(3), kinetin,
   and KNO3 treatments. In particular, once the embryo has developed
   sufficiently, a combined administration of 500 mg L-1 GA(3) and 20 mg
   L-1 kinetin was much more effective than either treatment alone;
   therefore, an appropriate method must be used based on the stage of
   embryo development.

AB Cornus kousa (kousa dogwood), used as a landscape tree and a source of
   food and medicine, is difficult to propagate from seeds owing to
   dormancy. The present study was conducted to develop an effective method
   of seed propagation and identify the seed dormancy type. Kousa dogwood
   seeds were classified as presenting physical dormancy (PY) and
   physiological dormancy (PD) from an immature embryo. Seeds were
   contained within an impermeable endocarp that conferred PY and had an
   undifferentiated embryo that grew and differentiated after scarification
   and cold moist stratification, leading to improved germination. To break
   PY + PD, four replicates of 50 seeds (3200 in total) for each treatment
   were prepared by scarification and cold moist stratification. These
   methods combined improved moisture absorption and germination more than
   either treatment alone. In particular, the addition of cold moist
   stratification treatment to scarified seeds could effectively induce
   embryo development. By contrast, untreated seeds showed low germination
   rate of less than 1% at 30 A degrees C with continuous light. Sulfuric
   acid (H2SO4) at different concentrations and durations was used to
   uniformly wound the endocarp of seeds. Treatment with 80% H2SO4 for 10
   min resulted in the highest germination rate (68.6%) and moisture
   content (65.7%), which were higher than those following polishing with a
   brushing machine for 5-40 min. Longer treatment with high concentrations
   of H2SO4 (80 and 100%) caused the acid to infiltrate the seed and
   inhibit germination by damaging internal tissues, while low
   concentrations (40 and 60%) did not affect germination rates even after
   treatment for more than 10 min. To obtain maximum germination,
   concentration and treatment duration of sulfuric acid should be
   carefully controlled.

   and efficient management of the production of seedling grafts, which are
   required for successful cultural practices. In this study, the base,
   optimum, and maximum temperatures of four hot pepper cultivars were used
   as scions as well as four hot pepper cultivars used as rootstocks were
   estimated using a quadratic model. Seeds of the cultivars were
   germinated in growth chambers at constant temperatures of 20 degrees C,
   25 degrees C, 30 degrees C, and 35 degrees C. Cumulative germination was
   described using a logistic function. The base, optimum, and maximum
   temperatures were estimated by regressing the inverse of the time to 50%
   germination (I/GR(50)) against temperature. Although germination rates
   varied according to cultivar and temperature, the highest germination
   rates were observed at temperatures of 25 degrees C and 30 degrees C.
   Wongang 1 was the most tolerant at low temperature, whereas Koregon
   PR-380 and Wongang I were the most tolerant at high temperature.
   Further, we suggest appropriate combinations of scion and rootstock
   cultivars based on our cardinal temperature results for the eight hot
   pepper cultivars.

AB This study was carried out to test seed germination responses to

   abilities in antioxidant activity, soil improvement and erosion control.
   H. rhamnoides seeds were placed at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35℃ under
   light condition. As the results, germination percentage (GP) was the
   highest at 15 and 20℃, and mean germination time (MGT), germination rate
   (GR) and germination value (GV) were the highest at 25℃. Quadratic and
   linear regression model were used to determine the cardinal temperatures
   such as base (Tb), maximum (Tm) and optimum (To) temperature for
   germination. In quadratic regression model using PG, Tb, Tm and To was
   estimated as 0.6, 36.4 and 18.5℃, respectively, and temperature range
   for germination was 35.8℃. In linear regression model using GR, Tb, Tm
   and To was estimated as 8.3, 35.4 and 25.3℃, respectively, and
   temperature range for germination was 27.2℃.Germination properties were
   investigated after H. rhamnoides seeds were treated by prechilling (1,
   2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks),stratification (2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks), solid matrix
   priming (seed : carrier : water = 5 : 1 : 7, 8, 9 and 10), osmo-priming
   (-0.25,-0.5, -1.0 and -1.5 MPa) and calcium chloride (CaCl2) -priming
   (100, 200, 300 and 400 mM). The highest GP was observed in CaCl2 300 and
   400 mM treatments, and MGT was the shortest in stratification 6 and 8
   weeks treatments. GR and GV were the highest and GP was the second
   highest when seeds were prechilled for 1 and 2 weeks. Consequently,
   prechilling 1 or 2weeks treatment was considered as the appropriate
   method when we contemplate qualitative and quantitative effects in
   seedling production.

AB Chitosan is an antimicrobial substance used to protect against a wide

   applied for many uses but there are very few reports of their antifungal
   activity in seeds. This research aimed to study the effect of chitosan
   polymer (M. W. 200 kDa) and chitosan nanoparticles on mycelial growth of
   four fungal species and on chilli seed quality. Potato dextrose agar
   (PDA) incorporating chitosan polymer and chitosan nanoparticles at a
   concentration of 0.6% w/v significantly delayed mycelial growth of
   Rhizopus sp. Colletotrichum capsici, C. gloeosporioides, and Aspergillus
   niger when compared with 0.15% w/v captan, 0.2% w/v chitosan
   nanoparticles, and the control (PDA). Chitosan polymer solution
   dissolved with 0.5% v/v acetic acid was applied as a coating substance
   on chilli seeds. The coating procedure was done by spraying chitosan at
   20 and 100 ppm on chilli seeds using top-spray fluidized bed coating
   equipment. Another two samples were sprayed with distilled water and
   0.5% v/v acetic acid. The treated samples were then monitored for
   infection and compared with the non-treated control samples. Coating the
   seeds with chitosan at 20 and 100 ppm by this technique resulted in
   lower seed infection compared with the other treatments. Seed coating
   with chitosan at 20 and 100 ppm, however, did not significantly affect
   moisture content, germination, germination after accelerated ageing,
   germination index, and mean germination time when compared with the
   control samples. Therefore, chitosan appears to preserve seed quality,
   and further investigations into longer periods of storage are being
   carried out.

   stratification under 4°C (0, 40, 50 and 60d) and gibberellic acid (0,
   100, 200 and 300 mg/litre for 24 and 48h) treatment on seed germination
   using an orthogonal design to break the seed dormancy of Malus Red
   Splendor. Seed germination reached a peak on the third day.
   Stratification under low temperature was the best method and seed
   dormancy was broken wholly after 60d, with the highest germination rate
   of 87.60%, significantly higher than those of other stratification
   treatments, while gibberellic acid could not completely break seed
   dormancy. The best concentration of gibberellic acid was 200 mg/litre,
   with the highest germination rate of 60.80% and a germination index of
   9.418, significantly higher than those of other gibberellic acid
   treatments. There were no significant differences of germination rate
   between 24 and 48h soaking with gibberellic acid. The best treatment
   combination was stratification of 60d under 4°C and soaking in 200 mg
   gibberellic acid/litre for 24h and the highest germination rate and
   germination index reached 90.5% and 16.296, respectively.

AB Seeds of Echinacea angustifolia are known for their deep dormancy. In
   this paper, we studied the responses of E. angustifolia seeds to some
   chemical and physical factors, such as scarification, chilling (5
   degreesC) period, light and applied BA (6-benzylaminopurine), GA(3)
   (gibberellic acid) and sound stimulation. When the seed coat layers were
   removed, the germination rate grew up from 6 to 20% (incubated in light)
   and the mean time germination (MTG) was reduced from 18 to 6.6 days. On
   the basis of layers-removed, chilling and continuous light gave
   significantly higher germination rate (up to 70%). Compare the data of
   seeds chilled by 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 days, the maximum germination rate
   (up to 70%) achieved at 18-days chilling treatment. Further increases in
   the chilling period could slightly improve germination. Exogenous
   application of 0.1, 0.2. 0.3 mg/L GA(3) or BA in the previous
   pretreatment increased germination to 78, 90 and 84% or 76, 86 and 84%,
   respectively. Obviously, the best concentration of GA(3) or BA is 0.3
   mg/L. And the GA(3) or BA treatment shortened the MTG to about 4 days.
   The influence of sound stimulation was also tested in the experiment.
   The result showed that one 100 dB and 1000 Hz sound wave (sine-wave) was
   beneficial to the germination of E. angustifolia seeds. (C) 2004

AB Aims: This study aimed to isolate and evaluate the indigenous
   fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. with bio-control potential against
   Rhizoctonia solani and promoting growth in chilli seedlings.
   Methodology: A total of 120 fluorescent bacterial were isolated from the
   healthy chilli rhizosphere soil from the seven major chilli cultivation
   localities in Terengganu, Malaysia. Only 115 Gram negative fluorescent
   isolates were further invitro screened for antagonistic activities
   against R. solani and plant growth-promoting properties. The 50 most
   effective fluorescent Pseudomonads antagonist against R. solani with
   minimum percentage inhibition of radial growth (PIRG) of 65% were
   selected. Hierarchical cluster analysis was further conducted with two
   dendrograms derived from SPSS Statistic 20 to facilitate the comparison
   between these 50 isolates for antagonistic and growth-promoting
   properties. A total of 40 fluorescent isolates within the most potential
   cluster were further selected and identified using 16S rRNA sequencing.
   Thirty four fluorescent isolates were identified as Pseudomonas spp. and
   six isolates as Burkholderia spp. The top 13 ranked fluorescent
   Pseudomonas spp. from the scoring index were evaluated for seed
   germination and vigor index in chilli seedlings. There was no
   significant difference in germination rate between fluorescent
   Pseudomonas inoculated with control. However, vigor index of chilli
   seeds pre-inoculated with fluorescent P. putida (B5C1), P. aeruginosa
   (B3C56) and P. putida (B5C7) were significantly increased with 4684.9,
   4657.3 and 4401.0 over control (P <= 0.05).
   Conclusion, significance and impact of study: These selected fluorescent
   isolates: P. putida (B5C1), P. aeruginosa (B3C56) and P. putida (B5C7)
   have the potential to be developed as biofungicide against R. solani and
   as growth-promoter in chilli production system.

   November germinated 25% and 31% respectively but the seeds picked on
   late September germinated only 3% in spite of treatment of low
   temperature for 60 days. Therefore the suitable season to pick the hips
   proved to be late October or later. -The duration of low temperature
   treatment for 40 days was sufficient to break seed dormancy, but
   treatment of GA 300ppm did not affect breaking seed dormancy. -It proved
   that optimum sowing and transplanting time for good quality rootstock
   production was middle February and late April respectively.

   stratified without a medium at moist low temperature for 0, 3, 5 and 7
   weeks at a constant temperature of 41°C or warm stratified for 3 weeks
   at 20°C for 8 h and 4°C for 16 h (20/4°C). After each stratification
   duration, the seeds were placed in a germination chamber at a
   temperature regime of 8 h at 30°C plus 16 h at 20°C (30/20) in darkness
   and Germination Percentages (GP) and germination rates (PV) were
   determined. 3, 5 or 7 weeks of cold stratification without a medium
   broke the seed dormancy and produced more than 90% germination.
   Germination rate was the highest after 5 or 7 weeks of cold
   stratification. The present study reveals that Pterocarya fraxinifolia
   has seed dormancy and 5 weeks of cold stratification without a medium is
   necessary to maximize seed germination percentage and germination rate.

AB Protocols for the conservation of threatened plants are often
   constrained by the absence of data on germination ecology. However, seed
   bank managers periodically monitor the viability of stored seed
   collections using germination tests. Here, we argue that data from those
   tests can and should be used to provide information on germination
   requirements of threatened species. Twelve taxa endemic to Portugal were
   used as a test case to determine the effect of incubation temperature
   and pretreatments upon germination and to identify major factors
   eliciting germination and releasing dormancy. We achieved maximum
   germination percentages >95% for nine taxa. Temperature significantly
   affected the final germination and mean germination time in most taxa.
   Maximum and faster germination at cool temperatures (15 degrees C or
   alternate 20/10 degrees C) was the prevailing trend. Cold stratification
   improved germination in one species, suggesting physiological dormancy.
   Scarification increased the germination percentage of one species among
   those expected to exhibit physical dormancy. Seed bank data provided
   valuable information on germination ecology, which can be used in
   in-situ conservation and as a baseline for further germination studies.
   Given the increasing threats to plant diversity, accessibility to seed
   bank data are paramount.

AB The effects of seed size, and of chilling and smoking pre-treatments on
   germination of commercial Eucalyptus regnans and Eucalyptus delegatensis
   seedlots selected from provenances at various altitudes were
   investigated. Seed viability was relatively high in E. regnans compared
   to that of E. delegatensis. Large E. regnans seed germinated at a faster
   rate than small seed, but there was no difference between E.
   delegatensis seed sizes. Chilling imbibed seed for 1 week at 4degreesC
   increased germination rate in the higher altitude E. regnans seedlot but
   had no effect on seed from the lower altitude. Chilling for 1 and 3
   weeks increased germination rate and percent in all E. delegatensis
   seedlots, with the greatest response being observed in seed from the
   highest altitude. Exposing seed to smoke had no effect on germination of
   either E. regnans or E. delegatensis.
   The results indicate that concerns over low germination rates in
   commercial E. regnans seedlots may be unfounded in some seedlots and the
   species could be successfully incorporated into commercial tree nursery
   operations without substantially altering management practices. However,
   for E. delegatensis improved seed cleaning and chilling imbibed seed for
   3 weeks prior to sowing may be required to improve germination rate and
   percentage. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Narrow-leaved bird's-foot-trefoil (Lotus tenuis) is a perennial forage
   legume adapted to waterlogged and heavy and infertile soils and can
   replace alfalfa (Medicago sativa) in areas with these soils in
   Argentina. Its seeds are hard and water-impermeable but the effects of
   environmental factors on seed dormancy and germination are not known.
   The objective was to evaluate the hypothesis that water availability
   during seed development and maturation affects the degree of
   hardseededness in L. tenuis by changing seed coat properties,
   conditioning water uptake through the seed coat; and subsequently
   affecting dormancy, germination and speed of germination. Seeds were
   harvested in December/January and in February in both 1993/1994 and
   1994/1995 from a permanent pasture of L. tenuis growing in a Hapludol
   soil in San Miguel del Monte province of Buenos Aires. Environmental
   conditions of each anthesis-harvest period were determined. Seeds of
   each harvest were subjected to chilling, washing and mechanical
   scarification. After 12 months seeds from each harvest were observed in
   a scanning electron microscope. The water deficit of the soil and
   relative humidity were greater in the second than the first
   anthesis-harvest period in both seasons. In 1993/1994 the control
   treatment in December had a higher germination rate than the February
   control seeds (0.40 vs. 0.20) and a faster germination rate. Mechanical
   scarification and chilling significantly enhanced the germination rate
   (0.95) and its speed in seeds of both harvests. Low temperatures
   significantly enhanced germination rate, starting after 60 d for the
   seeds harvested in December, and 90 d for the seeds harvested in
   February. In 1994/1995 the results were similar but both the January and
   February control treatments had higher germination rates (0.60 vs. 0.40)
   than in the previous year. Seeds harvested in February were more dormant
   in both years. These differences could be explained by the conditions in
   February anthesis-harvest period in both years that could have hastened
   the natural dehydration process of seed, changing integument structure
   and enhancing its impermeability.

AB Early sowing in cotton is important for obtaining a high and qualiy
   yield. Since cotton prefers high temperatures to have a good stand
   establisment, this work is important to determine better performing
   genotypes or to promote germination and emergence at low temperatures
   (<20 degrees C). This research aimed to increase seed germination rate
   and seed vigour under cold stress conditions. Two cotton genotypes
   belonging to G. hirsutum L. species (Aydin-110 and Paymaster-2379) were
   primed with PEG-6000 (200, 300, 400 g/L), KNO3 (2, 3, 4%), KH2PO4 (0.3,
   0.4, 0.5 M), NaCl (2, 3, 4%) or Mannitol (2, 4, 6%) to determine the
   best priming medium and its best amount. After priming, seeds were
   germinated in germination cabin at cold (18 degrees C) and warm (30
   degrees C) temperatures and some characteristics (germination rates,
   radicle length, hypocotyl length and seedling length) were analyzed.
   Priming with KNO3 (4% or 2%) was found to result in the highest
   germination rates in both cotton genotypes. The seeds of the genotypes
   were also primed with 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) (1, 10, 25 mg/L),
   gibberellic acid (GA(3)) (100, 250, 500 mu M), methyl jasmonate (MeJA)
   (1, 3, 5 mu M), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) (1, 10, 100 mu M) or kinetin
   (1, 5, 10 mg/L) added to KNO3 (4%) medium to choose the most effective
   plant growth regulator (PGR) application and its dose. PGRs were
   observed to have reverse effects on germination rate. Finally, emergence
   test was conducted with KNO3 (4%) and KNO3 (2%) using metabolic chill
   test, and some traits (radicle length, radicle weight, hypocotyl length,
   hypocotyl weight, seedling length, seedling fresh weight and seedling
   dry weight) were examined. Our results suggested that priming with KNO3
   (2%) might be an effecient way to have vigourous cotton plants under the
   cold stress.

AB Ventricina is a traditional sausage made from pork meat produced in the
   Abruzzi and Molise regions. The aim of this study was to detect the
   content of nitrates and nitrites in local cultivars of chilli pepper,
   and their concentration in ventricina samples spiced with the same
   chilli pepper. Furthermore, it was examined whether, in the samples of
   ventricina with nitrate addition, the spicing with chilli pepper could
   exceed the maximum added dose. The concentration of nitrates and
   nitrites in the organic chilli pepper was 531.0±94.6 mg/kg and less than
   5.0 mg, respectively, in the traditional chilli pepper it was 394.0±39.6
   and less than 5.0 mg, while in the commercial it was 325.0±115.0 and
   less than 5.0 mg. The determination of nitrites and nitrates was carried
   out by high performance ion chromatography. In ventricina samples
   produced without added sodium nitrate, nitrates and nitrites were below
   5.0 mg/kg at the case-filling time (t0) and after 50 days of aging
   (t50). In the samples of ventricina with added sodium nitrate, nitrate
   concentration values were 134.0±20.9 mg/kg at t0 and 129.0±15.4 mg/kg at
   t50, while the nitrites were below 5.0 mg/kg at t0 and 28.8±15.8 mg/kg
   at t50. Although in ventricina the amount of chilli pepper is quite
   relevant, it did not lead to a detectable concentration of nitrates. The
   maximum allowed amount was never exceeded.

AB Chinese pistache (Pistacia chinensis Bunge.) trees are valued for their
   fall color and pest resistance in landscape plantings; however, there
   are few cultivars of this species because of difficulties in
   propagation. Chinese pistache is primarily propagated by seeds. The
   objectives of these studies were (i) to determine the effect of the
   source plant on seed germination, and (ii) to determine the effect of
   scarification, stratification, and GA3 (3-0-beta-D-glucopyranosyl ether;
   Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) treatments on germination percentage
   and rate. Fruits of Chinese pistache were collected from four parent
   trees in 1988 and the pericarp was removed from half the seeds from each
   tree. Seeds with and without pericarp present received 0, 30, or 60 d of
   stratification at 36-degrees-F or were treated with 1000 ppm GA3. In
   1991, seeds were collected from two of the same trees and two different
   trees and the pericarp was removed from all seeds. Half of the seeds
   from each tree were treated with concentrated sulfuric acid. Both
   treated and nontreated seeds received 0, 30, or 60 d stratification at
   36-degrees-F or 1000 ppm GA3. Removal of the pericarp was necessary for
   seed germination regardless of other treatments provided. The
   germination percentage and rate depended on the parent plant from which
   the seeds were collected. Scarification and stratification generally
   increased germination percentage and germination rate. GA3 increased
   germination percentage in seeds from some parent plants, but was not as
   effective as stratification.

AB Fungicide application facilitates seed and seedling survival, but these
   pesticides may also negatively affect germination. Moreover, it is
   unclear how fungicide may interact with influential environmental
   conditions, such as cold stratification, to affect tree seed
   germination. We examined how fungicide and five different cold
   stratification durations of increasing length influenced tree seed
   germination (i.e., germination fraction and germination rate) for five
   important species commonly found in temperate North American forests
   (Abies balsamea, Acer saccharum, Picea glauca, Pinus resinosa, and Pinus
   strobus). Greater cold stratification durations increased A. saccharum
   germination fraction, had positive effects on P. strobus and A. balsamea
   germination fractions, and decreased germination for P. glauca. Longer
   cold stratification reduced time to germination for all species,
   reinforcing the importance of this pregermination condition in tree seed
   phenology. We also found that although Captan 50W fungicide had no
   effect on the germination fraction for any species, it delayed the
   germination of P. glauca and P. strobus at specific stratification
   durations. We suggest that delays in tree seed germination-mediated by
   fungicide application, reductions in stratification duration driven by
   warmer winters, or both-could hinder seedling survival and performance
   with long-term effects on the vigor of tree seedlings used for
   transplanting.

AB Wild asparagus (Asparagus acutifolius L.) is a widespread species found
   in all the Mediterranean areas. The spears are highly valued by
   consumers and owing to its frugality, this species is a feasible new
   crop with high income potential, especially for Mediterranean marginal
   areas. Currently, the cultivation of this species is limited because of
   its low and erratic seed germination that makes difficult the production
   of seedlings for plant propagation. In this research, non-after-ripened
   (I month-old) and after-ripened seeds (dry stored at room temperature
   for 13 months) were exposed for 30 days in the dark to three moist
   stratification treatments: cold (5 degrees C), warm (23 degrees C) or no
   stratification; Subsequently they were soaked for 12 h in warm water (35
   degrees C) or not soaked. The effect of these pre-germination treatments
   on three germination parameters (germination percentage, time to 50% of
   final germination - T-50 - and germination pattern) was studied, as well
   as some possible seed dormancy forms involved therein. The I year dry
   storage period proved to be effective in after-ripened seeds by
   enhancing seed sensitivity to the subsequent pre-germination treatments.
   After-ripened seeds exhibited higher and more rapid germination compared
   to non-after-ripened seeds. Soaking, cold or warm moist stratification
   had similar single effect on non-after-ripened seeds (27% germination).
   With after-ripened seeds, only soaking or warm stratification were
   effective (47% germination) when singularly applied, while cold
   stratification did not improve germination. By combining stratification
   and soaking treatments, a higher germination for both non-after-ripened
   and after-ripened seed-lots was achieved. The highest germination was
   obtained when after-ripened seeds were stratified and soaked (76%),
   without any significant difference between cold or warm stratification.
   Single or combined application of moist stratification (regardless of
   the temperature used) and soaking resulted always in a faster
   germination compared to that of no-treated seeds and especially with
   after-ripened seeds (T-50 = 6 days). A non-deep type 1 physiological
   dormancy can be hypothesized for the seeds of this species. Low
   stratification temperature induce secondary dormancy in after-ripened
   seeds that can be removed by soaking them at 35 degrees C for 12 h. V

AB Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a warm season, C4 perennial grass
   native to most of North America with numerous applications, including
   use as a bioenergy feedstock. Although switchgrass has emerged as a
   bioenergy crop throughout the midwestern and southern US, little
   information is available on the performance of switchgrass in the
   Northeast/Mid-Atlantic. In the first genetic diversity study of
   switchgrass populations to utilize both morphological and molecular
   markers, it was found that the combination of morphological and
   molecular markers differentiated populations best, and should be useful
   in future applications such as genetic diversity studies, plant variety
   protection, and cultivar identification.  In a study that evaluated
   several bioenergy traits of 10 switchgrass cultivars in NJ, populations
   with improved agronomic characteristics were identified. Cultivar Timber
   exhibited the best combination of characteristics and has promise for
   biomass production in the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic US.  In a third study,
   the effects of cultivar, location, and harvest date on biomass yield,
   dry matter, ash, and combustion energy content in three switchgrass
   cultivars were investigated.  Results indicated that a January harvest
   allowed for optimal feedstock quality and that cultivars Alamo,
   Carthage, and Timber produced high yielding, high quality biomass. In an
   effort to improve the establishment capacity of switchgrass, a fourth
   study was conducted examining the effects of divergent selection for
   seed weight on germination and emergence in three switchgrass
   populations over two cycles of selection, and cold stratification on
   germination in the derived populations. Selection for seed weight alone
   was not sufficient to improve germination and germination rate in
   populations tested, while cold stratification improved germination.
   Therefore, breeding efforts should be directed towards reducing dormancy
   in order to improve switchgrass germination and establishment.  The
   final two studies examined genotype x environment effects, estimated
   broad-sense heritability, and stability analysis on lignocellulosic and
   agronomic traits in switchgrass clones grown on marginal and prime soils
   in NJ.  Results support the existence of both specifically and broadly
   adapted switchgrass germplasm, and demonstrate the need for evaluation
   of germplasm across multiple years and environments (including prime and
   marginal sites) in order to develop cultivars with optimal
   lignocellulosic and agronomic characteristics.

AB Beach vitex is an invasive plant of coastal areas of the southeastern
   United States from Maryland to Georgia. Many resources have been
   dedicated to the control of established beach vitex stands. Successful
   eradication will require knowledge of this plant's ability to
   reestablish from seed after control efforts. To understand seed-based
   regenerative potential, studies were conducted to characterize the
   fruits and seeds, document the existence and size of seed banks,
   determine stratification requirements for germination, and ascertain
   seed dormancy mechanisms. Studies of fruit lots from three consecutive
   years (2003 to 2005) found that the average fruit contained 1.39 seeds,
   and more than 76% of fruits contained at least one viable seed. A
   positive correlation existed between seed number and both fruit mass and
   fruit diameter. A substantial soil seed bank was discovered that
   contained viable seeds 4 yr after vegetation removal. Stratification was
   required for seed germination. All stratification treatments induced
   germination, with highest rates realized when stratification was
   performed at 10 C for 8 or 12 wk. Germination rates were modestly
   increased (from 0 to 17%) through mild scarification in the absence of
   stratification. Results indicate that beach vitex has physical (fruit
   coat) and physiological (seed) dormancy mechanisms that are capable of
   delaying germination for multiple seasons, allowing development of a
   soil seed bank. Beach vitex can reestablish from seed after vegetation
   removal.

AB Dormancy of Caragana arborescens seed increases and moisture content at
   time of harvest decreases, as date of maturity approaches. Germination
   capacity of non-stratified seed decreased from 82 to 57 %, and
   germination rate (index) from 0.46 to 0.23, as seed moisture content
   decreased from 72 to 44% for 4 successive dates of harvest over a 20-day
   period. Germination capacity and rate increased materially, however,
   when m.c. of the seed at harvest fell below 40 % just before natural
   dehiscence of the pods. Stratification for 15 days at 41° F. induced an
   increase of <more than> 20% in germination of all seed having m.c. <less
   than> 70% at time of harvest or harvested 1-17 days before natural
   dehiscence. Dormancy was evidently much greater for seed harvested 24
   days before dehiscence and having a m.c. <more than> 70%. There was no
   significant difference in average germination capacity or rate for 1-
   and 2-year-old seed, but germination was consistently higher for the
   smaller (2.5-3.0 mm. diam.) than for the larger 2-year-old seed, and
   vice versa for the 1-year-old. KEYWORDS: Caragana arborescens

AB Seed germination depends on various biotic and abiotic interactions
   associated with maternal habitat. The formation of soil seed banks is a
   key strategy and has ecological implications, especially with regard to
   species that develop in extreme habitats. When establishing germplasm
   banks of these species from seeds, seed dormancy becomes one of the main
   difficulties. In this research, we study Colobanthus quitensis, a
   species with wide latitudinal and altitudinal distribution, inhabiting
   extreme environments from southern Mexico to maritime Antarctica.
   Furthermore, this species has been described to have a secondary
   dormancy that is dependent on the environment. In order to perform
   research without needing to have regular access to this species'
   habitats, it is therefore vital to possess plant material from different
   populations representing the species distribution. Thus, we evaluated
   the effects of various pre-germination treatments on germination
   percentage and time in four populations of the species. A differential
   and significant effect was evidenced, both among treatments and
   populations.Acid scarification increased germination percentage and
   decreased germination time. The best treatments were determined by
   population, and direct seeding after a brief period of cold
   stratification (4 degrees C) allowed us to achieve good germination
   percentages in at least three of the studied populations. This new
   evidence allows optimization in the introduction, development,
   characterization, and availability of plant material of the different C.
   quitensis populations in the Antarctic Vascular Plant Germplasm Bank.

AB Aims
   There are a number of mechanisms that regulate germination; among these,
   seed dormancy, one of the most important, is an adaptative mechanism in
   plants to promote survival by dispersing germination in space and time
   until environmental conditions are favourable for germination. The main
   goals of this study were to determine the temperature requirements for
   seed dormancy release and germination of Gentiana lutea subsp. lutea, to
   identify the class and level of seed dormancy and to suggest an optimal
   germination protocol.
   Methods
   Seeds belonging to two different localities were subjected to various
   pre-treatments, including cold stratification (0 and 5 degrees C), warm
   stratification (25/10 degrees C) and different combinations of these,
   and then incubated at a range of constant temperatures (5-25 degrees C)
   and 25/10 degrees C. Embryo growth during pre-treatments and incubation
   conditions were assessed at different times by measuring the embryo to
   seed length ratio (E:S ratio). The final germination percentage (FGP)
   and the germination rate (t(50)) were calculated.
   Important Findings
   Fleshy mature seeds of G. lutea subsp. lutea have linear underdeveloped
   embryos. Cold stratification at 0 degrees C was effective in overcoming
   the physiological dormancy (PD) and promoted embryo growth and
   subsequent germination. After cold stratification at 0 degrees C, both
   the root and the shoot emerged readily under a wide range of
   temperatures. G. lutea subsp. lutea seeds showed an intermediate complex
   morphophysiological dormancy (MPD). As regards the optimal germination
   protocol for this taxon, we suggest a period of cold stratification at
   ca. 0 degrees C followed by seed incubation at 10-20 degrees C. The
   optimal germination temperatures found for seeds of this taxon, as well
   as its pre-chilling requirement at 0 degrees C, suggest that it is well
   adapted to a temperate climate; this behavior highlights an increasing
   threat from global warming for G. lutea, which could reduce the level of
   natural emergence in the field, prejudicing also the long-term
   persistence of the natural populations in Sardinia.

   whose young spring sprouts are consumed in some areas of Italy. Although
   sometimes abundant in the natural vegetation, these species are not
   common on a country basis. Sprouts are therefore only locally
   commercially available. Cultivation could contribute to make them better
   known and increase vegetable product differentiation. Seed germination
   was investigated by applying the following treatments: control,
   concentrated H2SO4 for 5 or 10 minutes; GA(3) at 500 ppm coupled or not
   with H2SO4, ethrel 1 or 3 mM, KNO3 0.2 or 0.4%, natural stratification.
   Germination was very low, and of no practical interest, for S. aspera,
   ranging from 0 to 65% for the two other species. The mean germination
   time was 140-220 days. KNO3 and ethrel at low dose improved, GA3 and
   H2SO4 decreased, and stratification had no effect on germination.
   Germination time was shorter at higher germination rates. Domestication
   opportunities are discussed, considering growth habit, cultural traits
   and consumer acceptance.

   plant is to be realised. Germination tests incorporating conditions
   applicable to the plants natural, coastal habitat were carried out. The
   mature recalcitrant seeds were left unscarified, or were partly and
   completely scarified, Although not impairing imbibition, the pericarp
   proved to restrict radicle emergence as excised embryos displayed a
   higher germination rate than did the seeds with the intact pericarp.
   Temperatures of 25-30 degrees C appeared most suitable for optimal
   germination, with higher temperatures causing excessive fungal growth
   and rotting. As is common in recalcitrant seeds, stratification caused
   the loss of seed viability.

AB This study aimed to evaluate the effect of different chemical treatments
   used for breaking of seed dormancy on soil seed bank properties
   (density, species richness and seed germination rate). Soil sampling was
   done in sub-alpine Polur rangelands in 2012 after natural cold
   stratification. Therefore, 10 (4 m2) plots were systematically
   established along two transects. Soil samples were then divided into
   five equal subsamples in the laboratory. Each subsample was treated by
   one seed dormancy breaking method, i.e. gibberllic acid (GA3: 500 ppm)
   for 48 hours, H2O2 (1%) for 48 hours, KNO3 (0.1% and 0.2%) for 72 hours
   and without treatment (control). All germinated seeds in the greenhouse
   were checked and counted for a 3-month period every week. ANOVA was
   applied to compare seed germination rate among different treatments.
   General Linear Model was used to evaluate the effect of method, soil
   depth and the interactions on soil seed bank characteristics. In
   addition, paired t-test was used to compare the properties of soil seed
   bank of each treatment between the two depths. The results showed that
   seed bank density per m2 was highest in the treatment of gibberllic acid
   in upper soil layer (4827.2 seeds) compared with H2O2 (1%) for 48 hours
   (942.7 seeds), KNO3 of 0.1% (382.8), KNO3 of 0.2% (356.6) and control
   (585.4 seeds). Similarly, in the lower soil depth, the highest seed
   density was observed in the treatments of gibberllic acid and H2O2 (1%)
   for 48 hours, respectively. The average seed richness in upper and lower
   soil depths was highest in the treatments of gibberllic acid (2.9 and
   1.9) and H2O2 (1%) for 48 hours (2.6 and 1.7), respectively (P<0.05).
   Seed germination rate was highest in the treatment of gibberllic acid
   compared with the other treatments (P<0.05). We concluded that chemical
   methods such as gibberllic acid could be useful for breaking seed
   dormancy in the precise studies of the soil seed bank.

AB Mooseer (Allium hirtifolium Boiss.) is bulbous perennial herb widely
   used in pharmaceutical and food industry in Iran. We studied germination
   of mooseer seeds in two separate experiments. In the first experiment,
   we evaluated four treatments: sulfuric acid scarification, sandpaper
   scarification, cold stratification, and gibberellic acid (GA(3))
   application. In the second experiment, we evaluated combinations of
   these treatments. All treatments in the first experiment had no effect
   on seed germination, suggesting that mooseer seeds have physical and
   physiological dormancy. In the second experiment, the highest
   germination percentage (86.6%) was observed after five minutes
   scarification with sulfuric acid (75% v/v), followed by 60 days of cold
   stratification. Duration of sulfuric acid scarification (5, 10, and 20
   min) did not affect germination rates, but increasing duration of cold
   stratification (from 15 to 60 days), increased germination from 28.3% to
   86.6%. Our study showed that mooseer seeds have both physical and
   physiological dormancy.

AB Different conservation measures including domestication approaches are
   needed to preserve rare and extensively used plant species and to
   satisfy future market demands. Snow lotus (a common name used for a
   number of high altitude species in central Asia) species in Mongolia are
   important medicinal plants, mostly endangered at the regional level due
   to the extensive use for medicinal purposes and naturally limited
   distribution ranges. In order to develop effective conservation and
   cultivation approaches we studied the morphological and genetic
   diversity as well as the seed germination behavior of three populations
   of Saussurea involucrata in the Altay Mountains of Western Mongolia.
   Plant height and leaf length were measured on 41-53 randomly selected
   individuals in each population. Enhancement of seed germination was
   studied using either mechanical or chemical scarification with potassium
   nitrate and gibberellic acid. Genetic diversity within and among three
   populations of the species was analyzed using Amplified Fragment Length
   Polymorphisms. Plants in three populations differed in height and leaf
   length (P < 0.001). Plant size tended to be negatively correlated with
   habitat altitude. Seed germination rate was low and increased with seed
   soaking in gibberellic acid. However, the response of seeds to different
   treatments was rather population-specific. Most treatments did not
   significantly affect mean days to germination and the ratio of shoot to
   root dry weight of 2-weeks old seedlings. The level of genetic diversity
   in the studied populations was lower than the average value for other
   long-lived perennial herbs. Analysis of molecular variance revealed a
   high differentiation within populations (92 % of total variation)
   indicating sufficient gene flow among populations.

AB The dynamics of dormancy release during the stratification of apple
   (Malus domestica Borkh.) seeds was quantitatively described by three
   characteristics of seeds germination: the percentage of seeds that
   germinated by the tenth day, mean germination time, and the sum of seeds
   germinated in each of ten days (Timson's parameter), which allowed the
   assessment of the viability, the rate of dormancy release, and seed
   heterogeneity. We showed that apple seeds were characterized by a
   combined (physical and physiological) type of dormancy, with the seed
   coat and the embryo envelope being involved in the maintenance of
   physical dormancy. The addition of sucrose to the stratification medium
   accelerated the release of seed dormancy and improved all
   characteristics that determine seed germinability. Electrolyte leakage
   from embryos hardly changed during stratification, which agrees with the
   fact that all seeds remained viable throughout the entire period of
   dormancy. We assume that the release of seed dormancy is not a
   single-stage process.

AB Zygotic embryos were excised from immature and mature seeds of the
   Himalayan yew, Taxus wallichiana. The embryos germinated precociously
   when kept in darkness for 5 weeks and developed into full seedlings
   within 10-12 weeks. The highest rate of embryo germination (81%) was
   obtained in modified Lloyd & McCown's woody plant medium containing
   macro and micronutrients at half strength supplemented with 1% activated
   charcoal, which supported both the best embryonic growth (43%) and
   seedling development (32%). However, the supplementation of basal media
   with kinetin, thidiazuron, 6-benzyl aminopurine or GA(3) had no effect
   on the germination of the embryos, The embryos derived from immature
   seeds germinated but the frequency of embryonic growth was better in
   mature seeds. Stratification of seeds effected precocious germination of
   embryos. Seeds kept at 4 degrees C for 1 week germinated earlier and at
   a higher frequency irrespective of the stage of seed maturity, while the
   germination rate declined with prolonged cold treatment for I month at
   that same temperature. Analysis of taxanes in germinating seedlings
   revealed that root tissues contained high levels of taxol,
   10-deacetyl-baccatin III and baccatin HI as compared to shoots. Thus
   embryo culture technique appears to overcome the lengthy dormancy
   requirement of T wallichiana seeds.

AB Seed dormancy can affect life history through its effects on germination
   time. Here, we investigate its influence on life history beyond the
   timing of germination. We used the response of Arabidopsis thaliana to
   chilling at the germination and flowering stages to test the following:
   how seed dormancy affects germination responses to the environment;
   whether variation in dormancy affects adult phenology independently of
   germination time; and whether environmental cues experienced by dormant
   seeds have an effect on adult life history. Dormancy conditioned the
   germination response to low temperatures, such that prolonged periods of
   chilling induced dormancy in nondormant seeds, but stimulated
   germination in dormant seeds. The alleviation of dormancy through
   after-ripening was associated with earlier flowering, independent of
   germination date. Experimental dormancy manipulations showed that
   prolonged chilling at the seed stage always induced earlier flowering,
   regardless of seed dormancy. Surprisingly, this effect of seed chilling
   on flowering time was observed even when low temperatures did not induce
   germination. In summary, seed dormancy influences flowering time and
   hence life history independent of its effects on germination timing. We
   conclude that the seed stage has a pronounced effect on life history,
   the influence of which goes well beyond the timing of germination.

AB Using the "standard" germination method (dehydration, hydration before
   conserving at 5 degree C during several weeks or several months and
   rehydration followed by the germination at 27 degree C/28 degree C), it
   is possible to conserve grape seeds of Vitis vinifera c.v. Ugni blanc
   more than one year and preserve a high ability of germination. However,
   to be able to work on young seedlings rapidly after harvesting, this
   method requiring a too long breaking dormancy treatment (conserving at 5
   degree C), we tried to change these treatments and to speed up the
   breaking dormancy using an anoxic treatment finalized at the laboratory.
   Even if this system does not allow to obtain the best rate of
   germination, it allows to save 50 days for Ugni blanc treatment and more
   than 150 days for Merlot avoiding breaking dormancy with cold treatment.
   To improve the grape seed ability of germination following the
   "standard" method, we used a solution of etephon in external supply,
   releasing ethylene in tissues. Seeds conserved 90 days at 5 degree C and
   hydrated with this solution have a better rate of germination (+ 10 p.
   cent in comparison with a standard sample treated with the same method
   without ethylene). Finally, non conserved at 5 degree C grape seed
   lyophilization can be a rapid method for breaking dormancy and improving
   (at least 40 p. cent) the ability of germination.

   and inner bark are also used for yellow dyeing of clothes. The objective
   of the present study was to evaluate the seed dormancy, effect of
   stratification, light conditions and planting bed quality on seed
   germination of berberis manipurana seeds. A set of freshly processed
   seeds were sowed in three light conditions i.e., normal light (~5000
   lux), poly house ca. 50% shade (~2500 lux) and poly house ca. 75% shade
   (~1250 lux). In the laboratory, half of the collected seeds were packed
   in plastic bags, labeled and stored at 4°C (stratification treatment);
   another half was stored at room temperature of 25°C. Stratified seeds
   from both the conditions (4°C and 25°C) were sowed in the seed bed at 15
   days interval till 120th day (0-120 days) to check the viability and
   germination behaviors. Highest germination rate was observed from seeds
   stored at 4°C, which registered 82.5% (1.5) germination in the poly-bags
   against 70% (2.5) from seeds stored at 25°C. While 69% (2.0) and 56%
   (1.5) seeds germinated in the seeds beds from seeds stratified at 4°C

   when the seeds normally start to germinate. Fresh seeds were subjected
   to various treatments aimed at hastening embryo development and
   regulating germination time. They were sown in June or August (controls
   sown in May) and germination was assessed at intervals and finally in
   December. Soaking seeds in 1000 p.p.m. GA3 for 24 or 48 h followed by
   alternating cold-warm (4 and 30°C) moist stratification for 6 or 12
   weeks gave erratic and poor germination; this was no better than for
   untreated controls (average 31% seven months after sowing). Cold-warm,
   warm-cold or warm stratification alone resulted in little or no
   germination. However, cold stratification for 6 and 12 weeks without GA3
   pre-treatment improved germination considerably (average 63 and 69%,
   respectively). In the following year, 2 batches of stratified (4 or

AB Seed dormancy is a temporary failure of a viable seed to germinate.
   Various methods are used for breaking seed dormancy, depending on plant
   species and type of dormancy. Three seed populations originated from
   Esfahan, Semnan and Fars provinces were exposed to different seed
   dormancy breaking treatments such as mechanical and chemical
   scarification, humid chilling, GA3 and polyethylenglycol 6000 in order
   to break dormancy and improve seed germination. Unlike Semnan and Fars
   populations, Isfahan population did not show a significant positive
   reaction to treatments. Applying polyethyleneglycol solution of -10 bar
   for Semnan population and combination of moist chilling and
   polyethyleneglycol solution for Fars population resulted in the highest
   germination parameters. Germination percentage reached to 47.97% in
   Semnan and 64% in Fars population and mean germination time reached to
   1.55 and 2.26 days, respectively. Activity of alpha-amylase and
   beta-1,3-glucanase enzymes in seeds of oregano showed that non-dormant
   seeds exhibited significantly higher activity than dormant seeds.
   Different responses of oregano populations to applied treatments showed
   that intensity of dormancy is related to climate and origin of seeds and
   differs considerably among populations.

AB Specific knowledge about the dormancy, germination, and emergence
   patterns of weed species aids the development of integrated management
   strategies. Laboratory studies were conducted to determine the effect of
   several environmental factors on seed germination and seedling emergence
   of Cyperus difformis. Germination of freshly harvested seeds was
   inhibited by darkness; however, when seeds were subsequently transferred
   to complete light they germinated readily. Our results showed that 2 wk
   of cold stratification overcome the light requirement for germination.
   Seeds of C. difformis were able to germinate over a broad range of
   temperatures (25/15, 30/20, 35/25, and 40/30 degrees C day/night). The
   response of germination rate to temperature was described as a
   non-linear function. Based on model outputs, the base, the optimum and
   the ceiling temperatures were estimated as 14.81, 37.72 and 45 degrees
   C, respectively. A temperature of 120 degrees C for a 5 min was required
   to inhibit 50% of maximum germination. The osmotic potential and
   salinity required for 50% inhibition of maximum germination were -0.47
   MPa and 135.57 mM, respectively. High percentage of seed germination
   (89%) was observed at pH=6 and decreased to 12% at alkaline medium (pH
   9) pH. Seeds sown on the soil surface gave the greatest percentage of
   seedling emergence, and no seedlings emerged from seeds buried in soil
   at depths of 1 cm.

AB The seed dormancy and germination of Pinus bungeana were studied in
   naked embryos (seed capsule and endosperm were excised off) and embryos
   with whole or partial endosperm of the seeds either non-pretreated or
   stratified at low temperature. Naked embryos were cultured separately on
   agar-solidified media containing different concentrations of sucrose or
   on filter paper bridge. Embryos with whole or partial endosperm were
   cultured on filter paper bridge. The radicles of the naked embryos
   emerged on culture system of neither filter-paper bridge nor agar media
   supplemented with low concentrations of sucrose. Twenty percent of the
   radicles germinated on media containing 3.0% sucrose. The germination
   rate tended to increase when sucrose concentration ranged from 3-5.5%.
   The highest germination proportion (Gp) reached 40% and the germination
   index (Gi) was 6.5%/day. The remaining 60% of the embryos germinated
   even when sucrose concentration of the media was higher than 6%. For the
   non-pretreated seeds cultured on filter-paper bridge, 92 or 74.7% Gp was
   obtained in embryos with whole or two-third to half of endosperm. No
   growth of radicle, except hypocotyl elongation, was found in embryos
   with one-third of endosperm. The naked embryos was dormant but exhibited
   rapid hypocotyl elongation. A Gp of 90% was obtained by naked embryos on
   media supplemented with 3.0% sucrose after stratification. A Gp of 60%
   was observed on media with 4-5% sugar after GA3 treatment. It is
   suggested that the testas permeability was not the main factor that
   inhibit embryo germination.

AB Objective: The purpose of this study is to explore the effects of low
   temperature on the physiology of eggplant seedlings for rootstock,
   select the germplasms with strong cold resistance, and to provide a
   reference for the breeding of cold tolerant rootstocks suitable for
   grafting cultivation of autumn and winter tomato in South China. Method:
   Sixteen eggplant germplasms for rootstock were used as materials, and
   the low temperature treatment temperatures of 10, 15 and 20°C were set.
   The cold tolerance of eggplant germplasms for rootstock was evaluated
   according to germination index, chilling injury index and physiological
   index in the germonation and old temperature stress experiment. Result:
   The low temperature of 10°C significantly inhibited the germination of
   eggplant seeds for rootstock, and the germination rates were all less
   than 10.00% except that germination rate of J61 was 18.33%. There was no
   significant correlation among seed germination rate, germination index,
   germination potential and seedling chilling injury index(P > 0.05). The
   seedling chilling injury indexes of germplasm BC05 and J13 were
   0.16,0.20 respectively, showing high resistance(HR) to low temperature.
   The seedling chilling injury indexes of germplasm BC06,J60,AQ and A were
   0.27-0.40, which showed moderate resistance(MR)to low temperature. The
   chilling injury index of 8 germplasms such as BC01,BC02 and BC03 ranged
   from 0.40-0.56, which showed resistance(R)to low temperature. Under low
   temperature stress at 10°C, the chlorophyll content of the tested
   germplasm seedlings decreased, while the conductivity, malondialdehyde
   contents increased, and the activities of superoxide dismutase(SOD),
   peroxidase (POD)and catalase (CAT) increased, but the response degree of
   different germplasms were different. The chilling injury index of
   seedlings was extremely significantly (P < 0.01, the same below)or
   significantly (P < 0.05, the same below) positively correlated with the
   change rate of chlorophyll content and MDA content. It was significantly
   or extremely significantly negatively correlated with the change rate of
   Pro content, activities of SOD, POD and CAT, respectively. The
   subordinate function value of the low temperature resistance of the
   tested germplasms were analyzed. The above six germplasm with HR and MR
   were ranked in the top six for their comprehensive low temperature
   resistance. And the above six germplasms were classified as high
   resistance to low temperature or resistance to low temperature by
   cluster analysis. Conclusion: The index of seed germination should not
   be used as the identification index of cold tolerance of eggplant for
   rootstock. The seedlings chilling injury index, chlorophyll, MDA and Pro
   contents, SOD, POD and CAT activities can be used as the identification
   indexes of cold tolerance. The results of comprehensive evaluation show
   that BC05, J13, BC06, J60, AQ and A have high resistance to low
   temperature. And above six gemplasms can be used as backbone germplasm
   materials for breeding new varieties of cold-tolerant rootstocks.

AB This paper discusses how field and laboratory experiments, using a
   variety of genetic material, can be combined to investigate the genetic
   basis of germination under realistic ecological conditions, and it
   reviews some of our recent work on germination phenology of Arabidopsis
   thaliana in the field. Our results indicate that the genetic basis of
   germination depends on the environment. In particular, the conditions
   during seed maturation interact with post-dispersal environmental
   factors to determine germination phenology, and these interactions have
   a genetic basis. Therefore genetic studies of germination need to
   consider carefully the environment - both during seed maturation and
   after dispersal - in which the experiments are conducted in order to
   characterize genetic pathways involved with germination in the field.
   Laboratory studies that explicitly manipulate ecologically relevant
   environmental factors can be combined with manipulative field studies.
   These studies can identify the particular environmental cues to which
   seeds respond in the field and characterize the genetic basis of
   germination responses to those cues. In addition, a variety of genetic
   material - including mutant and transgenic lines, intact natural
   genotypes, recombinant genotypes, and near isogenic lines - can be used
   in field studies as tools to characterize genetic pathways involved in
   germination schedules under natural ecological conditions.

AB We identified a new role of phytochrome in mediating germination
   responses to seasonal cues and thereby identified for the first time a
   gene involved in maternal environmental effects on germination. We
   examined the germination responses of a mutant, hy2-1, which is
   deficient in the phytochrome chromophore. The background genotype,
   Landsberg erecta (Ler), lacked dormancy in most treatments, while hy2-1
   required cold stratification for germination in a manner that resembled
   a more dormant ecotype, Columbia (Col). Unlike Col, hy2-1 was not
   induced into dormancy by warm stratification. Therefore, the
   down-regulation of phytochrome-mediated germination pathways results in
   sensitivity to cold, but we found no evidence that reduced phytochrome
   activity enables the warm-induction of dormancy. Cool temperatures
   during seed maturation induced dormancy. The hy2-1 mutants did not
   overcome this dormancy, indicating that phytochrome-mediated pathways
   are required to break cold-induced dormancy. Ler did not respond to
   post-stratification temperature, but hy2-1 did respond, suggesting
   phytochrome pathways are involved in germination responses to
   temperature. In summary, phytochromes mediate dormancy and germination
   responses to seasonal cues experienced both during seed maturation and
   after dispersal. Phytochromes therefore appear to be involved in
   mediating seasonal germination timing, a trait of great ecological
   importance and one that is under strong natural selection.

AB White spruce (Picea glauca [Moench.] Voss.) seeds were moist chilled at
   5 degrees C in the dark under seven different regimes which altered the
   degree of seed hydration, and/or the presence and type of water
   containing media in contact with the seeds. Seeds that had been exposed
   to the regimes for 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 8, and 12 weeks were tested for
   germination percentage, mean germination time, and germination
   uniformity under alternating 20/30 degrees C temperatures far 16 and 8
   h, respectively. Seed from dormant seedlots had a lower percentage
   germination, and completed germination more slowly, and less uniformly
   if dormancy was not first alleviated. Moist chilling of any duration did
   not alleviate dormancy at or below 20% moisture content fresh weight
   (MCFW). In contrast, at MC's of 25% and greater, germination percentage
   was maximal after just one week of moist chilling, although the speed of
   germination benefited by an additional one to two weeks of moist
   chilling. The coefficient of uniformity of germination was maximal
   within two weeks of the commencement of moist chilling when it was
   affected by treatment. The type of treatment used influenced the
   stability of all three germination parameters over time. Moist chilling
   (stratification) between layers of 1:1 v/v moist sand/Perlite
   consistently had detrimental effects on all parameters, for all
   seedlots, as the duration of treatment progressed beyond four-five
   weeks. Some seedlots were more susceptible to death during treatment
   than others. Susceptible seedlots tended to sun;ive moist chilling for
   longer periods at MC's at or below 20% FW. The abrupt change in the
   efficacy of moist chilling in alleviating dormancy around 25% MCFW was
   associated with the boundary between water binding regions 3 and 4 based
   on sorpton/desorption isotherms for both white and sitka spruce. The
   best overall treatments were soaking seeds for 24 h in water prior to
   surface drying, and then moist chilling them in polyethylene bags (final
   MC similar to 25% FW), and moist chilling at uncontrolled MC in Petawawa
   germination boxes.

AB Samples of a seed lot of eastern white pine (Pinus strobus L.) from New
   Brunswick were cold stratified at moisture contents that reached five
   different levels from 17 to 40% of fresh weight at the end of 4 weeks. 
   Each sample was subsequently tested for germination and mean germination
   time.  Maximum seed germination occurred at a moisture content of about
   35%.  Three subsamples from another seed lot from the same area were
   subjected to cold stratification at a slightly suboptimal moisture
   content (30%) for 0, 2, or 4 weeks.  These stratified seeds were
   subsequently invigorated at 15-degrees-C at the same moisture content
   for 0, 7, 11, and 16 days.  (Vigour is used in this paper to describe a
   seed lot's mean germination time; increased vigour signifies faster
   germination).  The seeds were then tested for percent germination and
   mean germination time.  Increasing stratification and invigoration
   duration influenced percent germination positively, as did their
   interaction.  Drying seeds for 24 h prior to commencing the germination
   test decreased germination by about 5%.  Duration of stratification and
   invigoration were negatively and highly significantly related to mean
   germination time in a linear fashion, while their interactive term was
   nonsignificant and, therefore, not used when analyzing mean germination
   time.  Drying the treated seeds for 24 h increased mean germination time
   by about 1 day.  According to regression estimates, seeds germinated
   0.45 +/- 0.02 (mean +/- SE) day faster per day of invigoration for up to
   16 days treatment, while they germinated 1.44 +/- 0.06 days faster per
   week of stratification for up to 4 weeks stratification.

AB Sampling design and three sample treatments prior the application of the
   seedling emergence method were tested in order to find the best method
   for seed bank quantification in arid Nama Karoo rangelands. I analyzed
   species composition and seed densities by contrasting undercanopy and
   open-matrix samples from two soil depths and by comparing the effects of
   cold-, heat-, and no stratification on germination rates of species in a
   greenhouse setting. The soil seed bank showed minimal similarity to the
   standing vegetation, with only 20 plant species germinated. Spatial
   distribution of seeds was highly heterogeneous. Nearly 90% of germinated
   seeds were located in 0- to 4-cm compared to >4- to 8-cm soil depth.
   Undercanopy seed banks contained significantly more species and seeds
   than open-matrix seed banks. Neither the number nor the diversity of
   seeds germinated differed significantly among the three treatments. Cold
   stratification tended to detect more species and seeds only at >4- to
   8-cm soil depth. The results highlight the importance of spatial
   heterogeneity in the accurate evaluation of soil seed banks in the arid
   Nama Karoo and the importance of considering seasonal variability in the
   availability of readily germinable seeds. Data also suggest that sample
   pretreatment in germination trials may give little return for cost and
   effort, which emphasizes that it is more important to choose the
   sampling design most likely to give a representative number of seed bank
   species. Further studies are needed to analyze seed bank dynamics and
   species-specific germination requirements to promote recruitment of
   plant taxa underrepresented in the seed bank.

AB Background and Purpose: The current study aims to evaluate the effect of
   the fruit size of service tree (Sorbus domestic L.) on
   physio-morphological properties of seeds and the seed germination
   process.
   Materials and Methods: The fruit samples varying in size and divided on
   the basis of weight into small (5-10 g), medium (11-15 g) and large
   (16-20 g) were collected from the area of Vukomericke gorice (45 degrees
   34'45 '' N 16 degrees 00'11 '' E), Zagreb County, Croatia.
   Results: In all fruits, a significant, positive and very high
   correlation was found between the fruit length and width (r=0.92). There
   was a negative and significant correlation between the fruit weight and
   the fruit shape index (r=-0.47). The number of filled seeds in fruit was
   significantly higher in large fruits (2.62 seeds) than in medium and
   small fruits (1.81 and 1.46, respectively). Seeds from large fruits had
   significantly greater length of radicle (3.89 mm) than those from medium
   and small fruits (3.27 and 2.88, respectively) after 120 days of
   stratification at 3 degrees C. The mean germination time of seeds for
   all fruits in total was 107 days. The seeds with the highest weight had
   significantly lower rate of moisture absorption. After stratification
   the seeds of large fruits had the highest germination percentage
   (83.7%).
   Conclusions: The findings obtained will likely impact the propagation of
   this plant species in the future, because the results of the study
   favour the usage of seeds obtained from large fruits since they showed
   highest germination rate.

AB Elaeagnus mollis, an important nitrogen-fixing bush and a good woody oil
   plant, has a very low percentage seed germination. Experiments conducted
   in Shanxi, China showed that its seed dormancy was caused by mechanical
   resistance of the seed coat and inhibitors. When the seed coats were
   removed, germination rate reached >90%. Outdoor stratification (2-7°C)
   markedly promoted germination. Germination in the dark at 15-25° was 38%
   in 6 days, which was significantly lower than under 1000 lx or natural
   light at the same temperature in 3 days (84-92%).

AB Wood vinegar is the byproduct in activated carbon manufacture. To reuse
   wood vinegar in agriculture, the experiments of germination rate of
   chili pepper seeds and plate cultivation were conducted to explore the
   effects of wood vinegar on seed germination and the inhibition on
   pathogenic microorganisms of chili pepper. The results showed that the
   concentrated wood vinegar diluted for 100, 250, 500 times with water
   promoted significantly the seed germination and seedling growth of
   pepper when the seeds were soaked in the solution with different
   concentrations of wood vinegar. Meanwhile, seed germination rate,
   germination index, relative seedling height and root tolerance index
   were improved significantly compared with the control, accounting for
   4.72%-10.38%, 2.44%-13.06%, 12.60%-39.45% and 48.50%-132.34%,
   respectively. The concentrated wood vinegar diluted for 250 times had
   the best effect on promoting the seed germination and seedling growth of
   chili pepper. Moreover, the concentrated wood vinegar diluted for 250
   times enhanced the growth and development of beneficial bacteria
   significantly and the amount of Bacillus subtilis increased by 233.93%
   compared with the control (P<0.05). Besides, the concentrated wood
   vinegar diluted for 250 times inhibited fusarium oxysporum type II and
   fusarium oxysporum type IV for pepper significantly. The diameter of
   these two fungi reduced by 5.27% and 6.23% compared with the control
   (P<0.05), respectively. In summary, the concentrated wood vinegar
   diluted for 250 times improved the seeds germination, seedlings growth
   of chili pepper and inhibited the development of pathogenic
   microorganisms.

   reduced germination percentage, seedling stem height and diameter. The
   best germination (95.8%) was obtained with cracked coats sown in a lying
   position. The highest percentage of plants with more than 6 mm diameter
   at 20 cm above the soil level was obtained from intact seeds sown in a
   lying position. Sowing of intact seeds in a lying position also gave
   100% first-class seedlings with characteristic stem straightness. No
   significant differences in germination rate or speed and seedling growth
   were obtained from the GA treatments, except that soaked seeds
   germinated from 25 to 75 days, compared with 35-120 days in the control.
   GA reduced germination of seeds with cracked or removed coats. Fresh
   seeds left at room temperature with no special packing lost their
   viability after 14 days.

AB In vitro embryo culture enabled satisfactory germination of immature
   seeds produced in crosses from early ripening sweet cherry varieties
   (Prunus avium L.). Three varieties -'Rita', 'Bigarreau Burlat' and
   'Carmen'- were crossed with 'Early Star' as male parent. Germination
   rate was affected by the developmental stage of both fruit and embryo.
   Fruit ripening stage was a critical factor for culture infection rate
   that increased with maturity. In-ovule embryo culture on Murashige and
   Skoog medium without hormones improved the embryo size but did not
   increase the germination rate due to a further increase in infection
   rate. Ex-ovule embryo culture on Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented
   with BA 1 mg L-1, NAA 0.5 mg L-1, 20 g L(-1)sucrose, 10 g L-1 sorbitol
   and 6 g L(-1)agar during the stratification time increased embryo
   length. Germination was performed on Brooks and Hough medium at the 22
   +/- 1 A degrees C with 16/8 h light/dark photoperiod. The highest
   germination rate (75 %) was reached in embryos that were 3-4 mm in
   length, after 30-days stratification at 4 A degrees C. Embryos in fruits
   at green-yellow stage that were 3-4 mm long were morpho-physiologically
   developed to produce bipolar seedlings, without combined application of
   embryo culture and micropropagation.

AB A study was conducted to find out the efficacy of organic and inorganic
   priming on germination and seedling vigour of bird's eye chilli
   (Capsicum frutescens L.) seeds collected from eastern Himalayan region
   of India. Results showed that, all studied traits were affected by
   priming treatments and there was completely significant difference
   (p≤0.05) in germination percentage between primed and non primed seeds.
   Among all priming treatments, 1% KNO3 (39.68% higher) recorded the
   highest germination percentage as compared to non primed control. Other
   best treatments recorded were 2% KH2PO4 (37.50% higher than control)
   followed by 200 g/Kg seed neem leaf powder (NLP) (35.12% higher than
   control) and 3% KNO3 (35.12% higher than control). In addition to this,
   200 g/Kg seed NLP treatment recorded lowest mean germination time (13.53
   days) while control recorded maximum mean germination time (21.63 days).
   From the study it was concluded that, seed treatment with NLP is
   essential for pre and post storage treatment of seeds, as it maintained
   seed viability and seedling vigour optimally among all other treatments.

   investigates the use of liquid seaweed extract (SWE) of Kappaphycus
   alvarezii (K-sap) and Gracilaria edulis (Gsap) as seed priming agent for
   Capsicum frutescens. The aims of the study were (1) to investigate the
   effects of seaweed extract priming at various concentration and duration
   on germination and seedling vigour of C. frutescens seeds, (2) to
   determine the possible effect of seaweed extract priming on the
   physiological and biochemical changes of in the seeds, and (3) to study
   the morphological traits of seedling and changes in the reproductive
   traits after priming treatments. Priming significantly improved
   germination percentage, mean germination time, vigour index and seedling
   weight. Moreover, we studied the electrolyte leakage, total phenol, DPPH
   assay and ABTS assay of both primed and non-primed seeds. Morphological
   traits of seedling and changes in the reproductive traits after priming
   treatments were found to be significantly improved upon priming. We used
   PCA biplots for separation of the priming treatments by using seedling
   traits. Overall we recommended the treatments P21 (K-sap; 1:100 for 48
   h), P16 (K-sap; 1:25 for 72 h), P6 (K-sap; 1:1 for 48 h), P42 (G-sap;
   1:25 for 48 h), P35 (G-sap; 1:5 for 24 h) and P37 (G-sap; 1:5 for 72 h)
   for improving the germination, storability and higher fruit yield in C.

AB The inheritance of speed of germination and its genetic relations with
   seed dormancy was investigated in lisianthus (Eustoma grandiflorum). The
   study was based on data from parental, F1, BC1F1 and F2 generations of a
   cross between a normally germinating genotype (P1) and a chill-requiring
   genotype (P2). The mean post-chilling germination speed of P2 was
   considerably lower than that of P1. Germination speed was found to be
   under nuclear embryonic control. Analysis of generation means for
   prechilled seeds revealed an additive gene action with complete
   dominance of the alleles conferring higher germination speed, since the
   means of the F1 and the BC1(P1) were indentical to that of P1. Such
   dominance was not found for unchilled seeds, in which the mean
   germination speed of the F1 and the BC1(P1) was lower than that of P1.
   It was hypothesized that slow germination speed was induced by
   pleiotropic effects of seed dormancy alleles. Seed prechilling seemed to
   eliminate these effects in progeny heterozygous for dormancy alleles,
   but not in progeny homozygous for dormancy alleles.

   that the International Seed Testing Association (ISTA) rules, which
   focus only on germination capacity, do not provide an adequate

   seedlots, genetic differences, which can be large in heterogenous forest

AB Germination in mountain hemlock, Tsuga mertensiana (Bong.) Carr., was
   investigated using 19 seed sources from British Columbia. Neither light
   nor stratification for 28 days had any significant effect on germination
   capacity, but light significantly (p less than or equal to 0.01) reduced
   germination rate. Stratification significantly increased germination
   rate in all seed sources, although the amount of total variation
   attributable to this effect was small. Stratification did not overcome
   the effect of light, and it is recommended that seeds should be covered
   after sowing in the nursery. All sources, including one from the
   interior of the province, germinated relatively uniformly. No
   correlations could be found between germination parameters and age,
   source elevation and seed weight, but germination capacity and seed
   weight were correlated with latitude. No correlation existed between
   seed weight and elevation. For most sources, a test duration of 21 days
   was adequate for complete germination even of unstratified seeds.
   Mountain hemlock seeds should be stratified before being sown in the
   nursery, and they should be covered during the germination phase to
   exclude light.

AB The germination of loquat seeds faces certain problems. The present
   research was designed to study the promotion of the germination of
   loquat seeds by moist-chilling and GA(3) applications. The results
   showed that loquat seeds display an endogenous dormancy that can be
   released by moist-chilling treatment for a certain period. In this
   respect, the best treatment was moist-chilling for 3 weeks at 5 I
   degrees C or I week of moist-chilling followed by soaking in 250 ppm
   GA(3) solution for 20 h. These treatments significantly increased
   germination percentage (88 and 85%, respectively) and decreased time to
   50% germination (T50) (31.5 and 40.7 days, respectively) compared to
   control (51% and 56 days, respectively). Also, the characteristics of
   the obtained seedlings were much better than the control seedlings. In
   addition, the 3-week moist-chilled seeds contained the highest soluble
   protein concentration and were characterized by the synthesis of new
   protein band of 161.7 kDa that was absent in all other treatments. This
   treatment lead to the absence of five polypeptides bands (222.5, 201.5,
   109.5, 7 1.1 and 49.3 kDa), which were synthesized in GA3 treatment, and
   the presence of a higher number of polypeptide bands compared with those
   of other moist-chilling periods and the control treatments. However,
   increasing the moist-chilling period over 3 weeks significantly
   decreased both germination percentage and T50. The combination between
   GA3 and moist-chilling treatments produced differential effects on seed
   germination, soluble protein and the number of protein bands depending
   on the length of the moist-chilling period. Although GA3 application on
   unchilled seeds resulted in more synthesis of protein bands than other
   tested treatments, it did not improve the germination process. The
   concentration of soluble inorganic phosphorus of the tested seeds was
   negatively (r = -0.57(*)) and the concentration of soluble organic
   phosphorus positively (r = +0.49(*)) correlated with the germination
   percentage. It was concluded that treatment of moist-chilling for 3
   weeks or I week moist-chilling followed by 250 ppm GA(3) is recommended
   for promoting the germination process of loquat seeds and improving
   growth characteristics of the subsequent seedlings. (c) 2005 Elsevier

   its seeds have a slow, unsynchronized germination rate. Enhancing seed
   germination is crucial for improving the production of black cumin. The
   influence of presowing treatments [gibberellic acid (GA3), potassium
   nitrate, salicylic acid, and stratification at 4 degrees C] on seed
   germination was assessed. Seed germination was determined daily for 30
   days, and germination parameters, including final germination percentage
   (FGP), corrected germination rate, number of days to reach 50% of FGP,
   and seedling length vigor index, were evaluated. Endogenous contents of
   GA3 and abscisic acid (ABA) in nonstratified and stratified seeds were
   estimated using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and
   seedling growth was determined in 45-day-old seedlings. All presowing
   treatments tended to boost early germination for the first 10 days
   compared with the control. Low concentrations of GA3 at 0.25 gmiddotL21
   also increased FGP (80%) compared with the control group (65.55%).
   Stratification for 4 weeks provided the greatest FGP value at 95.56%,
   and stratification for 3 weeks proved to be the most effective treatment
   for optimal seedling growth. Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel
   electrophoresis patterns of stratified seeds revealed the alteration in
   intensities of 13 bands and the appearance of a new band (180 kDa)
   indicating a change in the synthesis of proteins during stratification.
   Moreover, stratification modulated the endogenous GA3 and ABA contents
   of black cumin seeds, which alleviated the physiological dormancy and
   resulted in high and synchronized seed germination.

   ecological groups in the species (22 populations) of the section
   Violidum, subgenus Nomimium, genus Viola. Conditions for seed
   germination, as well as germinating ability, germination energy,
   intensity of germination energy, longevity of seeds and profitability of
   their ability, and the period when the seed germinating ability
   decreases by 50% (P-50) have been determined. The seeds of most species
   of xeromesophytes and mesophytes massively germinate at +23aEuro broken
   vertical bar+25A degrees C within a period of 10 days. For other species
   of these ecological groups, cold stratification is favorable. The
   hygromesophytes are characterized by prolonged seed germination (up to 2
   months). The petrophyte seeds have shallow physiological dormancy (B1).
   The seeds of other species are, as a rule, nondormant.

AB The European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) is one of the most important
   broadleaved species in European forestry, which grows in the Republic of
   Moldova on approximately 1,450 hectares of natural protected areas.
   Beech is propagated by seeds, but its seed formation is irregular.
   Therefore it is necessary to store the seeds and to obtain a high
   germination percentage, which could be maximise by cold stratification.
   The aim of our research was to study the germination of Fagus sylvatica
   L. seeds after cold stratification by followed characteristics:
   germination energy; total germination; coefficient of speed germination;
   mean daily germination; mean germination time. The beech seeds were
   exposed to stratification at a temperature of +41°C and a humidity of
   30%. The seeds germination started on tenth day and continued during
   three months. The maximum of germination energy (calculated on 30th day)
   and total germination was equal to 27.0 and 72.3%, respectively. Mean
   germination time was 55.485.72 days, and coefficient of speed
   germination constitued 1.720.24. The germinated seeds were sown and the
   bio-morphological features of beech seedlings were studied in nursery
   condition. The period of seedling appearance after sowing of germinated
   seeds was minimum 10 days, maximum 29 days. The proportion of grown
   seedlings from germinated seeds was about 69.2%. A clear dependence of
   seedling number on stratification time of beech seeds was not
   established. The chlorophyll index of seedling leaves after 45 days of
   growth was determined and compared with a similar leaf index in adult
   plants of European beech.

AB Objective: To develop a protocol for breaking of seed dormancy and
   increasing the seed germination rate of Bunium persicum.Methods: The
   seeds were treated with 3.1, 6.3: 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 mu mol/L of
   benzyl aminopurine, gibberellic acid (GA(3)), thidiazuron (TDZ) and
   forchlorfenuron. Then, seeds were transferred to two different
   temperature conditions including room temperature (25 degrees C) and
   chilling temperature (2-5 degrees C).Results: The treatment of moist
   seeds with chilling temperature (2-5 degrees C) broke seed dormancy and
   showed maximum germination, which was 54.7% after 60 d treatment. Also,
   the treatment of dry seeds with chilling temperature broke seed dormancy
   with 9.3% germination rate after 120 d. Treatment of seeds with
   different level of plant growth regulators showed that under moist-room
   condition, there was evidence of higher and lower seed germination rate:
   GA(3) (100 mu mol/L) with 46.7% and TDZ (50 mu mol/L) with 6.67%
   respectively. In addition, the results showed that under moist-chilling
   condition, TDZ (6.3 mu mol/L) with 53.3% seed germination rate had
   higher influence on breaking seed dormancy. Treatment of seeds with
   combination of TDZ and GA(3), under moist-chilling condition revealed
   higher rate of breaking of seed dormancy when 6.3 mu mol/L TDZ was
   combined with 100 mu mol/L GA(3), showing 93.7% germination
   rate.Conclusions: The effect of plant growth regulators coupled with
   chilling temperature on breaking of seed dormancy could provide a large
   number of seedlings while the long juvenile time which is the next
   restricting factor of plantation still remained. Thus, the subsequent
   growth of seedlings to provide a large number of corms is necessary for
   successful plantation.

AB Salicylic acid (SA) and gibberellins (GAs), as two important plant
   growth hormones, play a key role in increasing plant tolerance to
   abiotic stress. They contribute to the increased plant antioxidant
   activities in ROS scavenging, which is related to the enzymes involved
   in H2O2-detoxifying. In photosynthetic cycles, the endogenous form of
   these phytohormones enhances photosynthetic properties such as stomatal
   conductance, net photosynthesis (PN), photosynthetic oxygen evolution,
   and efficiency of carboxylation. Furthermore, in cell cycle, they are
   able to influence division and expansion of cell growth in plants under
   stress, leading to increased growth of radicle cells in a meristem, and
   ultimately contributing to the increased germination rate and lengths of
   shoot and root in the stress-affected plants. In the case of crosstalk
   between SA and GA, exogenous GA(3) can upregulate biosynthesis of SA and
   consequently result in rising levels of SA, enhancing plant defense
   response to environmental abiotic stresses. The aim of this paper was to
   investigate the mechanisms related to GA and SA phytohormones in
   amelioration of abiotic stress, in particular, heavy metal stress.

AB Introduction: Weeds, as the most important biological stress, reduce the
   efficiency of water use, waste of food, shading and secretion of toxic
   substances, leads to a 10 to 100 percent reduction in crop yields. The
   first step of the weed control understands the biology and life cycle of
   the weed particularly seed Eco physiological characteristics. Dormancy
   in weed seeds, including Redroot Pigweed seeds, is common. So, due to
   the importance of dormancy breaking and germination studies of weed
   seeds, the present study was designed to identify the methods for
   dormancy breaking and the germination of Redroot Pigweed seeds.
   Materials and Methods: This research started in autumn 2013 by
   collecting Redroot Pigweed seeds from fields of Alajujeh village, Khoda
   Afrin County, East Azerbaijan Province, and then it was carried out at
   the Laboratory of the Faculty of Agriculture of the University of
   Maragheh in 2014 and 2015. For data analysis, the GenStat 12.1 program
   was used and the Duncan test was used at 5% probability level to compare
   the averages. Excel 2013 was also employed for drawing the diagrams.
   Results and discussion: Analysis of variance demonstrated that the
   effect of treatments on germination percentage and germination rate in
   Redroot Pigweed seeds at 1% probability level and the mean germination
   time at 5% probability level was significant. The results showed that
   among studied treatments, seeds holding for 18 months were most
   efficient seeds dormancy breaking at Redroot Pigweed. So that the
   highest germination percentage (92%), germination rate (29.18 seed/day)
   and lowest the mean germination (4.2 day) time were obtained in seeds
   holding treatment. Pre-chilling treatment also had significant effects
   in stimulating germination. As regards treatments of seed holding in low
   temperature and Pre-chilling accelerate the germination process and
   increase germination percentage, so, having precise information of these
   traits enables to study, a better management and control of this
   troublesome weed. Conclusions: In general, the results of this study
   show that among the treatments, holding seeds for 18 months at 6° C is
   the best method for solving Redroot Pigweed seeds weeds.

   germination of unstratified or stratified seed. NAA treatment, using
   similar concentrations, did not increase germination of unstratified
   seed or those stratified for 30 days but increased germination was
   obtained with seed stratified for 60 to 120 days; the increase was

AB Verbascum yurtkuranianum is a narrow endemic species occurring in a
   single location, the northern Bursa province (Turkey). It is an
   endangered and potentially ornamental plant. No conducted study on its
   life and biology, production, and aesthetic features is available. This
   study aimed to reveal its vegetative properties, seed characteristics,
   methods and requirements for seed germination, germination speed, and
   potential ornamental value so it can be conserved ex situ and produced.
   Verbascum yurtkuranianum has potential value as an ornamental plant
   regarding its aesthetic features as a flower. This study revealed that
   the total number of individuals in the species is 788. Without any
   treatment, 70.7% germination rate is achieved if the seeds are stored at
   4 degrees C. The optimum germination temperature was from 15 to 20
   degrees C (77.3% and 78.7%, respectively), and the photoperiod
   regulation for seed germination was 12/12 or 8/16 (light/dark) hours
   (74.7% and 76.0%, respectively). The most effective treatment to promote
   germination rate was found by implementation of 60 min ultrasonic waves
   (94.3%) or application of 120 min vacuum (95.3%). Germination occurred
   between 8 and 10 days. A parcel of ex situ conservation was constituted
   with the seedlings obtained from the germination studies.

   moist warm stratification + moist cold stratification, moist cold
   stratification + soaking in GA(3) and control. The germination test was
   carried out at +20 degrees C in dark. The highest final germination
   percentages were obtained from the treatments of soaking in 500, 750,
   1000 ppm GA(3), soaking in 250, 500 ppm GA(3) + 4 weeks of moist cold

AB Most Pinus species are obligate seeders. Thus, knowledge of germination
   characteristics can help in the understanding, prediction and
   manipulation of the regeneration and dynamics of pine forests. Seven
   pine species with contrasting habitat preferences and different genetic
   pairwise distances are present in the Iberian Peninsula and the Canary
   Islands: P halepensis, P. nigra, P. pinaster, P. pinea, P sylvestris, P.
   uncinata and R canariensis. These seven pine species comprise an
   exceptional experimental set to test some questions related to
   germination traits, such as: (1) What are the effects of light and
   temperature on germination, taking into account interpopulation
   variability? (2) Is there any association of germination traits with
   habitat (montane versus lowland) preferences? and (3) What is the
   relationship between germination traits and the genetic distance between
   pine species? P nigra, P sylvestris and P. uncinata seeds showed faster
   germination rates. Seeds of P. nigra and P. sylvestris reached high
   total germination percentages in every temperature and light treatment,
   suggesting an opportunistic germination strategy. Unlike montane pines,
   lowland pines did show significant effects of temperature on germination
   response: final germination was higher between 15degreesC and 20degreesC
   than at warmer and alternating temperatures. Relatively low temperatures
   associated with the winter rainy season would favour germination of most
   of these species. Nested models showed that population variability was
   the main source of variation in germination response. Thus, there is no
   phylogenetic control of the germination response and, surprisingly,
   germination traits were not related to habitat preferences. As a
   consequence, we believe that studies of the germination characteristics
   of a pine species should consider different populations.

   both alone and combined, were also investigated. In addition, the
   effects of nickel (Ni) on germination and early seedling growth were
   evaluated. When inside the indehiscent silicles, imbibition of seeds was
   hampered and germination completely inhibited. Immediately after
   removing the pericarp, the seeds were able to imbibe as good as isolated
   seeds, but their germination rates were significantly lower when the
   removed pericarps were included in the Petri dishes. All the GA3
   concentrations, moist chilling, both alone and combined, significantly
   shortened mean germination time (MGT), and increased the germination
   index (GI) and the germination percentage (GP). Excess Ni did not affect
   GP, but inhibited seedling growth. In conclusion, the pericarp inhibits
   seed germination, both chemically and mechanically, through impeding
   imbibition, in F. garcinii. Moist chilling or GA3 improves the speed and
   final percentage of germination. Seedling growth is much more sensitive
   to Ni excess than seed germination. (C) 2017 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

AB Carex divisa is a patrimonial rhizomatous species and acts as an
   important component of grazed wet permanent grassland on the French
   Atlantic coast. This study treated three storage regimes (wet-cold,
   dry-cold and dry-warm), burial in soil, fluctuating temperature and
   salinity on seed germination of C. divisa. The seeds were dormant at
   maturity. No seed germinated after 2 and 6 weeks of dry storage under
   laboratory conditions prior to the onset of the stratification
   treatment. Thus, the effect of after-ripening was not evident in C.
   divisa. Germination rate of 11.3% started only in the wet-cold
   stratification treatment after 2 months. Seeds that had been stored
   under wet-cold conditions for 8 months had a higher germination than
   seeds stored under dry-cold and dry-warm treatments for the same length
   of time. Seeds of C. divisa tested at 10-20 degrees C in light had no
   marked dormancy cycle, but in darkness under a fluctuating temperature
   regime (10-20 degrees C), C. divisa seems to exhibit annual dormancy
   cycles. There were no differences in germination between fluctuating
   temperatures 10-20 degrees C and 15-25 degrees C after 12 months in the
   wet-cold treatment. No germination occurred at fluctuating temperatures
   0-10 degrees C. The highest percent germination was observed in
   distilled water, followed by 50 mM L-1 NaCl. The highest NaCl
   concentration (250 mM L-1) was found to inhibit seeds germination.

AB In recent years, spring late coldness has caused a lot of damage to
   mountain ash seedlings in the mountainous nurseries. This research aimed
   to reduce mountain ash seedlings damage due to spring late coldness. The
   research was carried out during 2007 and 2008, in Darzikola nursery
   (Farim Wood Co.), located 17 kilometers far from southeast of
   Pol-e-Sefid city of Mazandaran province of I.R. Iran. Seeds were treated
   by two levels of seedling cover (nylon sheet and control), and four
   levels of seed sowing dates (Fourth week of February (1), first week of
   March (2), fourth week of March (3) and second week of April (4)) under
   split plots design with three replications. The trial was repeated for
   two years. Results showed that effects of sowing date on seed
   germination rate were significant (p<0.01), whereas effects of cover
   treatments and interactions between the two treatments were not
   significant on seed germination rate. Effects of cover treatments on
   seedling height were significant (p<0.05). Seedling sowing date
   treatments had different effects on seedlings height. For instance,
   seedling height increased gradually at first treatment, whereas reached
   its maximum height at third treatment and then decreased. Effects of
   seed cover, sowing date and their interactions on mortality rate of the
   seedlings due to spring late coldness were significant. The mortality
   rates of the seedlings at covered and control treatments were 80 and 20
   percent, respectively. There were not significant differences in
   seedling loss at different levels of sowing date treatments when they
   were covered by nylon sheet, whereas at control treatment, the mortality
   rate decreased significantly when the sowing date reached the second
   week of April. Due to seedlings propagation productivity and mortality
   rate caused by coldness, it is suggested: first to sow the seeds at 15th
   March to 1st April, after application of one year cold stratification
   treatment and second to cover the plots containing the mountain ash
   seedlings by nylon sheets against probable coldness.

AB The response of seeds germination from Apiaceae, Kelussia odoratissima,
   which have interesting horticultural and medicinal properties, was
   established. In order to optimize germination factors for the first
   time, seeds were exposed to different types of treatment. In the first
   experiment, different times of stratification (0, 15, 30 and 45 days at
   4°C) were tested, and the best stratification time was 45 days. In the
   second experiment, the results of the first experiment were followed by
   various leaching durations (0, 12 and 24 hours with running tap water),
   Gibberellic Acid (GA3) (0, 500 and 1000 ppm concentrations for 12 hours)
   and germination temperatures (5, 10 and 15°C). The treatments, arranged
   as a factorial experiment, involved three replications per treatment in
   a completely randomized design. Results revealed that long
   stratification (45 days) stimulated germination percentage (GP) and mean
   germination time (MGT) compared to lower times of stratification. It
   seems that applying external GA3 has no effect on K. odoratissima seed
   germination. Different temperatures during seed germination affect MGT
   and GP significantly as the highest MGT and GP were at 5°C and 10°C,
   respectively. The duration of leaching diminished GP and the best MGT
   was observed in treatments with no application of leaching. In
   conclusion, the best germination of K. odoratissima was achieved at 10°C
   after 45 days stratification in 4°C.

AB Garlic clones collected in Soviet Central Asia were grown at Kagoshima,
   Japan, and they produced seeds. Their seed productivity varied with the
   clones. One of the pollen-fertile clones could not produce any viable
   pollen, while a male-sterile clone, No. 200, could produce the largest
   number of seeds per plant. The seed germination was compared at three
   different temperatures: the best germination was seen at 5.degree. C;
   the second best at room temperature (mean 18.7.degree. C); the worst at
   12.degree. C.  However, the germination peak at 5.degree. C existed from
   11 to 21 weeks after seed soaking, while at 12.degree. C and at room
   temperature it existed within three weeks after seed soaking. The seeds
   of the male-sterile clone, No. 200, showed the highest germination rate
   among those of the examined clones. Dry seed storage at 5.degree. C, at
   -20.degree. C, and at room temperature for three or six months did not
   increase germination rate so much as moist-chilling at 5.degree. C.
   Plant hormone treatments did not increase it, either. Some seedlings
   from the germinated seeds formed bulbs and flowers within one year from
   the seed harvest.

AB Total phenolic content (TPC) and antioxidant activity (AOXA) of olive
   (Olea europaea L.) sprouts were measured in three cultivars (Arbequina,
   Moraiolo and Leccino). Olive seeds, obtained by manually breaking whole
   stones derived from de-stoning ripe fruits, were sown in plastic trays
   and subjected to cold stratification for 30 days. The trays were then
   moved to 25 degrees C and 16:8 light:dark regime. Total germination was
   27% in Arbequina, 18% in Leccino, 14% in Moraiolo. Mean germination time
   (MGT) was 10 days in Leccino and Moraiolo and 14 days in Arbequina.
   Shoots were progressively harvested once the cotyledons were completely
   unfolded, i.e., between 8 and 16 days after germination. Sprouting
   dramatically increased TPC and AOXA in all cultivars (on average, 14 and
   30 times higher, respectively, compared to seeds), with Moraiolo and
   Leccino showing higher values than Arbequina. Sprouting olive seeds
   appears to be a valid way to obtain antioxidants for food
   supplementation or pharmaceutical purposes.

AB OBJECTIVE: To research the mechanism of dormancy and find out the

   METHOD: The water permeability of seed coat was tested by weighing
   seeds. The germination inhibitor of the seeds were determined with
   biotic measurement. The development of embryos, germination rate and
   germination potential were determined after stratification.
   RESULT: The water permeability of seed coat was 41.86% after 5 h. The
   extracts of seeds had strong inhibition effects to the length growth of
   cabbage seedlings. The growth and development of embryos under the cold
   stratification (5 degrees C) were better than that under the other
   conditions. The embryo rate extended from 15.39% to 86.21% after 90 d.
   Germination rate and germination potential after stratification under 5
   degrees C were significantly higher than that under other temperatures.
   CONCLUSION: The results showed that there was no obstacle of water
   permeability on the test of E. wushanense, after-ripening of
   embryogenesis and the germination inhibitor of the seed were the main
   reason for the seed dormancy. The cold stratification would be an
   effective way for breaking of the dormancy, which could significantly
   promote the seed embryogenesis and increase germination rate comparing
   to other methods.

AB Cyclocarya paliurus is native to China and is the sole species in its
   genus. However, the seeds remain deeply dormant for 2 years in their
   natural environment. We tested different pretreatments of chemical
   scarification and exogenous application of gibberellic acid (GA(3)) for
   efficacy in breaking dormancy and speeding germination. In contrast to
   scarified seeds, non-scarified seed did not germinate, indicating that
   C. paliurus seeds have hard, impermeable seed coat dormancy. Exogenous
   application of GA(3) significantly enhanced germination of scarified
   seeds. Compared with seeds stratified in sand with water, the
   germination of seeds stratified in sand moistened with 400 ppm GA(3) for
   60 days was significantly increased and germination rate was over 90%
   after 120 days. Analysis of variance indicated that both GA(3)
   concentration and stratification medium had significant effects on seed
   germination and final germination percentage. Germination was higher for
   longer stratification periods, but no significant difference in
   germination was observed after 90 days. These results suggested that C
   paliurus seeds exhibit both exogenous and endogenous dormancy. A
   combination of chemical scarification and exogenous application of GA(3)
   alleviated seed dormancy in a relatively short period of time. (c) 2006

AB Acer velutinum Boiss is a valuable tree species native to Iran, and its
   seeds possess physiological dormancy that hampers seedling production in
   the nursery for large-scale reforestation efforts. The aim of this study
   was to determine the optimal dormancy breaking treatments for A.
   velutinum seeds. We conducted a factorial experiment involving six seed
   lots collected along an elevation gradient from 300 to 1800 m at 300 m
   interval and four cold-moist stratification periods (0, 4, 8 and 16
   weeks) at 4 degrees C and 70% relative humidity. The result shows that
   the germination of cold-moist stratified seeds was significantly (p <
   0.0001) higher than the control for all seed lots. The highest
   germination capacity was recorded after 16 weeks of cold-moist
   stratification for all seed lots (68%-88% depending on the seed lot)
   except those collected from mid altitude sites (600 and 900 m) that
   germinated equally well (>= 75%) after 4- and 8-week of clod-moist
   stratification compared to the other seed lots. The mean germination
   time was significantly shorter (12 to 19 days, depending on the seed
   lot) for seeds stratified for 16 weeks than for untreated seeds. It can
   be concluded that: (1) cold-moist stratification for 16 weeks is the
   best pre-sowing treatment for breaking dormancy in A. velutinum seeds;
   and (2) seeds should be collected from mid altitude sites (600 and 900
   m) to get more than 80% germination within 15 days, and these seed lots
   even required shorter cold-moist stratification period (eight weeks)
   than other seed lots.

AB In order to survey the effects of dormancy-breaking treatments on
   germination in Astracantha adescendens, a completely randomized design
   was implemented at four replications. Treatments were : hot water
   scarification with 70 degrees and 90 degrees C for 10 and 15 min,
   sulfuric acid scarification (15, 30 and 45 mm), seed stratification for
   2,4 and 8 weeks, scarification (with hot water or acid) + seed
   stratification (4 week). Results showed significant differences among
   seed dormancy breaking methods (P<0.01). The highest germination rate
   and the lowest mean germination time were obtained with 90 degrees C
   water for 15 min+4 week stratification (83%) and 90 degrees C water for
   10 min+4 week stratification (81%) treatments. Seedlings were, however,
   injured during 45 min acid scarification procedure.

AB Echinacea purpurea (Asteraceae) is an important medicinal plant known as
   a disinfectant. Its germination percentage and germination rate is
   generally low due to dormancy. Dormancy and germination requirements
   were investigated in this plant. Seeds of Echinacea purpurea were
   subjected to different treatments including various levels of GA3 (100,
   200 and 300 ppm), KNO3 (0.5, 1 and 1.5 percentage) and Cold
   stratification (7, 14, 21 and 28 days). The germination percentage and
   germination rate significantly increased in all of treatments than
   control. The highest germination and germination rate were obtained in
   Cold stratification treatment that induced about 98% germination. The
   mean germination time also improved in all of treatments than control.
   Lowest mean germination time also was observed in Cold stratification
   treatment.

AB As maize is a chilling-sensitive crop, low temperatures during the early
   stages of development can be injurious to crop growth and development.
   Prime mechanism behind chilling-induced damage is oxidative stress. This
   study was undertaken to improve the chilling tolerance in hybrid maize
   by seed priming with KCl. For priming, seeds of the maize hybrid Hycorn
   8288 were soaked in 50, 100 and 150 mg l(-1) aerated solution of KCl for
   24 h and then re-dried close to original weight. Primed and untreated
   seeds were sown at 27 degrees C (optimal temperature) and at 15 degrees
   C (chilling stress) under controlled conditions. Seed priming improved
   the performance of maize under both normal and stress conditions. It was
   found that the chilling tolerance in maize is well associated with the
   enhanced capacity of the anti-oxidative system. Priming with KCl
   significantly improved the chilling tolerance mainly by the activation
   of antioxidants including catalase, superoxide dismutase and ascorbate
   peroxidase enzymes. KCl treatments also improved the germination rate
   and time, root and shoot length, and fresh and dry weights of seedlings
   compared with control. Soluble sugars and alpha-amylase activity
   determined as general metabolic indicators of stress were also improved
   by seed priming with KCl. Other possible bases of chilling tolerance in
   maize included maintenance of high tissue water contents, reduced
   electrolyte leakage and carbohydrate metabolism. Seed treatment with 100
   mg l(-1) KCl was the best treatment to improve the performance of hybrid
   maize both under normal and chilling stress conditions.

AB Abiotic stresses, including chilling, impede the plant growth and
   development mainly by oxidative damage. In this study, seed priming with
   CaCl2 was employed to reduce the damage caused by chilling stress in

   Treated and untreated seeds were sown at 27 degrees C (optimal
   temperature) and 15 degrees C (chilling stress) under controlled

   damage and improved the germination rate, root and shoot length, and
   seedling fresh and dry weights. Activities of antioxidants, including
   catalase, superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase, were also
   improved. Soluble sugars and alpha-amylase concentrations determined as
   general metabolic indicators of stress were also increased by seed
   priming with CaCl2. Priming also improved the performance of maize at
   optimal temperature. Maintenance of tissue water contents, reduction in
   membrane leakage and increase in antioxidant activities, and
   carbohydrate metabolism seemed to induce chilling tolerance by CaCl2.
   Seed priming with 100 mg l(-1) CaCl2 was the optimal concentration in
   improving the performance of hybrid maize both under optimal and stress

AB Plant growth and development is hampered by various environmental
   stresses including chilling. We investigated the possibility of
   improving chilling tolerance in hybrid maize by glycinebetaine (GB) seed
   treatments. Maize hybrid (Hycorn 8288) seeds were soaked in 50, 100 and
   150 mg l(-1) (p.p.m.) aerated solution of GB for 24 h and were dried
   back. Treated and untreated seeds were sown at 27 degrees C (optimal
   temperature) and at 15 degrees C (chilling stress) under controlled
   conditions. Germination and seedling growth was significantly hindered
   under chilling stress. Moreover, chilling stress significantly reduced
   the starch metabolism and relative water contents (RWC), and increased
   the membrane electrolyte leakage. However, activities of antioxidants
   (catalase, superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase) were increased
   under stress conditions. Seed treatments with GB improved the
   germination rate, root and shoot length, seedling fresh and dry weights,
   leaf and root scores, RWC, soluble sugars, alpha-amylase activity and
   antioxidants significantly compared with untreated seeds under optimal
   and stress conditions. Induction of chilling tolerance was attributed to
   maintenance of high tissue water contents, reduced membrane electrolyte
   leakage, and higher antioxidant activities and carbohydrate metabolism.
   Seed treatment with 100 mg l(-1) GB was the best treatment for improving
   the performance of hybrid maize under normal and stress conditions
   compared with control and other levels used.

   The seeds of den chickpea (cv. Punjab-2008) were soaked in aerated water
   (hydropriming), or in solutions of CaCl2 and KCl (psi(s) -1.25 MPa;
   osmopriming) for eight hours. After priming, seeds were thoroughly
   rinsed and either surface dried (SD) or re-dried (RD) near to original
   weight with forced air under shade. All the seed priming treatments
   improved the coefficient of uniformity of emergence (CUE), emergence
   index (EI), seedling dry weight (SDW), specific leaf area (SLA) and
   germination metabolism. Highest improvements in EI, SDW, SLA, a-amylase
   activity and total soluble sugars were recorded with SD-osmopriming of
   CaCl2. Among the priming strategies, SD-priming was better than
   RD-priming. In conclusion, seeds surface dried after priming may be used
   in chickpea for improvement in stand establishment and plant growth, if
   immediate sowing is feasible. Osmopriming with CaCl2 stimulated the
   germination metabolism, more than other priming treatments, which was
   translated to greater improvement in stand establishment and growth.

   germination and breaking of seed dormancy of Astragalus tribuloides. The
   seeds were treated using different methods of scarification and

   without chilling) resulted in higher (97%) seed germination, vigour
   index and germination rate. Mechanical scarification with sandpaper was
   the most appropriate treatment to make the seed coat permeable to water
   without adverse effect on the embryo. The lowest germination was
   observed for the control, stratification, hot water and freeze-thaw
   treatments. Considering low germination percentage in 7 days of
   stratification (without scarification), the hardness of seed coat can be
   a major reason of dormancy in A. tribuloides.

   1 month at the constant temperature of 23 C, then 3 months at 4 degrees
   C. The alternate temperature regime was 1 month at 4 degrees C, then 2
   weeks at 23 degrees C followed by 1 month at 4 degrees C, then 2 weeks
   at 23 degrees C, then 1 month at 4 degrees C. The effects of these
   treatments were evaluated and results showed that treatments of PGPR
   inoculation stimulated germination in terms of percentage of seed
   germination, speed of germination and mean germination time, and effect
   was significant at (p <0.05). Higher percentages of seed germination
   (18.33%) and speed of germination (4.82 number/day) were recorded for
   co-inoculated seeds by the combination of all bacterial inoculants and
   the alternate temperature stratification regime. Results showed a higher
   percentage of seed germination using alternate temperature
   stratification than for the constant temperature stratification regime.
   These results suggest that PGPRs in combination were effective in terms
   of promoting germination of C pseudoheterophylla seeds. (C) 0 2014

AB Prairie dropseed (Sporobolus heterolepis [A. Gray] A. Gray) is a
   warm-season grass that is an important component of remnant tallgrass
   prairies of North America, but is rarely found in restorations. We
   conducted three experiments to determine germination rates of prairie
   dropseed under different conditions in an attempt to potentially
   increase its successful establishment under field conditions. In the
   first experiment, we evaluated the duration of cold-moist stratification
   on the germination of prairie dropseed. Seeds were cold-moist stratified
   for 0, 30, or 60-d at 4 degrees C and then placed in a dark growth
   chamber at 26 degrees C. The other two experiments consisted of seeds
   planted in three different soil media: 1:1:1 soil:peat:perlite mixture,
   non-compacted field soil, and compacted field soil. They were then
   exposed to full irradiance or 50% shade. Germination was highest for
   seeds cold-moist stratified for 30 or 60 d. Seeds planted in either
   non-compacted or compacted field soil had higher germination rates than
   the 1:1:1 mixture in both full irradiance and 50% shade. We conclude
   that prairie dropseed has higher germination percentage after a period
   of cold-moist stratification. While our results indicate that seeds
   germinate better in field soil, germination rates were low compared to
   the amount of viable seed. It also appears that seed of prairie dropseed
   germinate at relatively higher levels under partial shade.

   mixing the seeds and wet sand into a clean container in a ratio of 1:3;
   covering with a plastic wrap, putting 10-15 small holes on the wrap, and
   obtaining germinated seeds after 40 days of low-temperature
   stratification; (c) nursery ground preparation: 7-10 days before sowing,
   watering the nursery water-permeable ground, deep-cultivating at 25-40
   cm, planting the seedlings, preparing a planting pit, a layer of 5-10 cm
   thick straw, and a layer of organic fertilizer on the straw; spraying
   light salt water on the sides of the planting pit at 25-35 degrees C;
   (d) planting: gently pressing down one end of the seedling into the
   soil; after sowing, spreading a layer of finely sifted soil just to
   cover the seeds, building a small bed, and placing and tightly closing
   with a shed film; (e) seedling management: controlling the temperature
   at 25-35 degrees C and humidity at 80-90%, when the temperature is too
   high, the shed film is immediately opened, ventilated and cooled;
   covering the grass curtain insulation, spraying 800-1200 times of
   aqueous carbendazim solution or thiophanate methyl solution once a week
   to prevent the occurrence of blight and anthracnose; (f) fertilizer and
   water management: when the seedling grows to 30-40 cm tall, using a
   strip method to excavate a deep groove of 20-30 cm between the rows of
   the seedlings, applying 40-50 kg/ mu g compound fertilizer, and 20-40
   kg/ mu g urea, covering it again, and watering it once a day for 20-30
   days; and (g) pest control: when the disease occurs, spraying with a
   Bordeaux mixture comprising copper sulfate, quicklime and water at a
   ratio of 1:1:100 for 2-3 times in succession, where each interval time
   is 7-15 days; and when there are pests, spraying with organophosphate
   insecticide or using light to trap.

AB The embryos of Ginkgo biloba L. are generally reported to undergo
   after-ripening and be underdeveloped at the time of dispersal, which
   suggests that the seeds have morphological dormancy (MD) or
   morphological physiological dormancy (MPD). The aim of this work is to
   determine whether embryos of a G. biloba population are well-developed
   at the time of seed dispersal, and whether the seeds are dormant or not.
   From 8 September, which was the 140th day after flowering (140 DAF),
   seeds were collected separately from trees (T) and the ground (G) every
   10 days until 7 December (230 DAF), resulting in a total of 10 samples.
   The changes in vertical diameter, transverse diameter, fresh weight,
   water content, and embryo length during seed development were measured.
   Simultaneously, the effects of different temperatures (15, 25, 30, and
   35 degrees C) on seed germination, dormancy, and germination
   characteristics of G. biloba seeds were studied. Results showed that the
   embryos of G. biloba seeds were well developed and had no morphological
   dormancy. On 18 September (150 DAF), embryos were visible with a length
   of 2.5 mm. On 7 December (230 DAF), at the time of seed dispersal, their
   length was 17.1 mm. The germination percentage of the isolated embryos
   and seeds increased as the delay in seed collection increased, but there
   was no significant difference between T and G (p > 0.05). On 7 December
   (230 DAF), the germination of the isolated embryos reached 98%,
   indicating that the embryos were nondormant. Without pretreatment, seed
   germination was 82.57% within four weeks at 25 degrees C. Furthermore,
   the germination test at different temperatures showed the highest
   germination percentage at 30 degrees C (84.82%). Obviously, the G.
   biloba seeds were nondormant. The mean germination time (MGT) of the
   seeds at 30 and 35 degrees C was significantly lower than that of the
   seeds at 15 and 25 degrees C, and the speed of germination (SG) was
   significantly higher than that of the seeds at 15 and 25 degrees C.
   Although there was no significant difference in the seed-germination
   percentage between 30 and 35 degrees C, a portion of the seeds (9.5%)
   rotted at 35 degrees C. Therefore, 30 degrees C was the most favorable
   germination temperature for G. biloba seeds. This is the first study
   that reports G. biloba seeds with no dormancy.

AB Assumptions about the germination ecology of alpine plants are presently
   based on individual species and local studies. A current challenge is to
   synthesise, at the global level, the alpine seed ecological spectrum.
   We performed a meta-analysis of primary data from laboratory experiments
   conducted across four continents (excluding the tropics) and 661
   species, to estimate the influence of six environmental cues on
   germination proportion, mean germination time and germination synchrony;
   accounting for seed morphology (mass, embryo : seed ratio) and
   phylogeny.
   Most alpine plants show physiological seed dormancy, a strong need for
   cold stratification, warm-cued germination and positive germination
   responses to light and alternating temperatures. Species restricted to
   the alpine belt have a higher preference for warm temperatures and a
   stronger response to cold stratification than species whose distribution
   extends also below the treeline. Seed mass, embryo size and phylogeny
   have strong constraining effects on germination responses to the
   environment.
   Globally, overwintering and warm temperatures are key drivers of
   germination in alpine habitats. The interplay between germination
   physiology and seed morphological traits further reflects pressures to
   avoid frost or drought stress. Our results indicate the convergence, at
   the global level, of the seed germination patterns of alpine species.

AB The seed germination niche partly determines adaptation, ecological
   breadth and geographic range in plant species. In temperate wetlands,
   environmental temperature is the chief regulator of germination timing,
   but the ecological significance of high and low temperatures during
   dormancy break and germination is still poorly understood. Our aim was
   to characterize the temperature dimension of the germination niche in
   mountain base-rich fens, determining (1) the effect of different
   temperatures on dormancy break and germination, and (2) whether
   different germination strategies may be identified at the species level.
   We conducted laboratory germination experiments with seeds of 15 species
   from these habitats, collected in 18 fen sites in the Cantabrian
   Mountains (Spain) for two consecutive years. In all the species, the
   seeds were totally or conditionally dormant at dispersal and
   stratification produced a significant increase of germination. In most
   cases, there was not an obligatory requirement for cold temperatures
   during dormancy break, since warm stratification promoted germination as
   well. Although the optimal germination thermoperiod was generally high
   (30/20 A degrees C), most species could also germinate at lower
   temperatures after cold-stratification. We also identified a group of
   species associated to cold-water springs that germinated only at low
   temperatures. Our results demonstrate that dormancy break in mountain
   base-rich fens does not obligatorily depend on cold temperatures during
   overwintering. Furthermore, germination at cool temperatures may be more
   widespread in wetland habitats than previously thought. The existence of
   two distinctive germination strategies, 'warm' and 'cool', can
   potentially give rise to divergent species responses to climate change.

AB Brassica chinensis var. parachinensis was introduced in Brazil in 1992.
   This variety presents a high content of vitamin A and a short life
   cycle. Seeds were submitted to 24 treatments in laboratory conditions
   and 12 treatments in field conditions with the objective of evaluating
   the germination pattern and seedling growth. In laboratory conditions,
   seed germination was light independent and the germinability was reduced
   in 12% by the action of sodium hypochlorite scarification. Gibberellic
   acid, KNO3, mechanical scarification and stratification did not modify
   the germinability of the seeds (96-100%) neither the average time of
   germination (1-1.28 days) in relation to the control treatment. In field
   conditions the highest values of emergence (89.2-96.4%) and the highest
   rates of emergence velocity (14.2-17.4) occurred in soil with mineral
   fertilization, between 0.5 and 1.5 cm depth. Shorter average times of
   emergence were registered from 0.5 to 1.5 cm depth (2.90-3.97 days), for
   the three fertilizers tested (mineral fertilization, cattle manure, and
   chicken manure). Seedlings were sensitive to sodium hypochlorite with
   significant reduction of hypocotyl and primary root. Stratification of
   seeds by 24 hours stimulated growth of primary roots improving the
   establishment of seedling in the soil.

AB Phytophthora capsici is a highly destructive pathogen of crops. Although
   chemical pesticides are the most widely used strategy to counter
   phytopathogens, they have been inefficient to combat P. capsici and have
   produced significant environmental and health problems. Therefore,
   sustainable alternatives to control soilborne pathogens, such as the
   inhibitory effect of self-extracellular DNA (eDNA), have been proposed.
   This inhibition phenomenon has been attributed to the action of
   self-eDNA as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP). Here, we
   describe the effect of self-eDNA on P. capsici zoospore germination
   rate, antioxidant enzymes activity and MAPK gene expression. Also, the
   effect of P. capsici eDNA on the protection of chilli pepper (Capsicum
   annuum) plants against P. capsici was investigated. The results
   highlight that P. capsici can sense 2-500 mu g/ml self-eDNA and induce
   stress-related responses like SAK1 gene expression, and superoxide
   dismutase and catalase activities. Moreover, in vitro zoospore
   germination rate was suppressed with self-eDNA concentrations ranging
   from 50 to 500 mu g/ml. Interestingly, drench applications of P. capsici
   eDNA at 60 and 100 mu g/ml on chilli pepper plants did not show any
   protective effect against the phytopathogen, whereas 2 mu g/ml of P.
   capsici eDNA drench application showed a lower percentage of plants with
   symptoms and lower disease severity. Moreover, phenols and total
   flavonoids were increased in chilli pepper plants, therefore inducing
   plant immunity. This study showed that self-eDNA acts as a DAMP in P.
   capsici and provides insight into the use of eDNA for the protection of
   crops of agronomic interest.

AB The present study was carried out to investigate the effect of cold

   grandiflora L. Seeds were subjected to 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 days cold
   stratification at 5 C. After each stratification period, seeds were
   putted in polyethylene bags under saran greenhouse till the germination
   ceased. During germination stage, Imbibitions period (IP), total
   germination period (TGP), germination percentage (G %), germination
   index (GI), germination value (GV), mean germination time (MGT) and the
   speed of emergence (SE) were recoded. At the end of the experiment root
   main length, lateral root number and root fresh weight, shoot height,
   seedling total length, vigor index, shoot fresh weight and leaves area
   were measured. Results obtained clearly indicate that increasing cold
   stratification period enhanced germination parameters as well as
   seedling characteristics. The most effective stratification period was
   90 days of cold stratification followed, in most cases, by 120 days cold
   stratification treatment. In order to enhance seed germination and
   seedling growth of Magnolia grandiflora, treating seeds with 90 or 120
   days of cold stratification was recommended.

AB Canopy gap and chilling requirements for seed germination were assessed
   in 61 and 44 species, respectively, in the temperate rain forest of
   southern Chile. Germination assays within canopy gap and understorey
   were carried out under natural conditions. Germination tests in cold
   stratified and non-stratified seeds were performed under laboratory
   conditions. Seeds were collected of common trees, shrubs, vines and
   perennial herbs of forests in southern Chile. Final percent germination
   was significantly enhanced under canopy gap conditions in 19 species,
   and significantly reduced in 11 species. Germination proved indifferent
   under gap vs. understorey conditions in half the species tested. Cold
   stratification affected germination in 11 species: significantly
   increasing final germination of four species, and significantly
   decreasing final percent germination of seven species. A Principal
   Components Analysis (PCA) was applied with the purpose of identifying
   groups of species with similar germination strategies. Four attributes
   were included in the PCA: final germination percentage in canopy gap,
   germination rate in the laboratory, and gap- and chilling-dependency
   indices (EGAP and STRAT, respectively). The first axis separated species
   mainly on EGAP variation while the second axis separated them mainly
   according to STRAT variation; the two axes together explaining 73% of
   the among-species variation. A small group of trees and vines
   germinating best in the understorey and neutral to chilling could
   clearly be distinguished from the remaining species analyzed.
   Multifactorial ANOVAs were used for evaluating the combined effect of
   successional status, seed mass, dispersal period, life form,
   phylogenetic categories, and dispersal syndrome on EGAP and STRAT
   variation. The EGAP value of secondary successional species proved
   significantly greater than that of primary successional species and
   species with endozoochorous seed dispersal were significantly less
   dependent on chilling (according to STRAT values) compared to species
   with mainly wind-dispersed seeds. The possible implications of these
   results for seedling establishment are discussed.

AB Rapid and uniform germination of the seeds is beneficial for commercial
   production of seedlings and for breeding programmes in eggplant (Solanum
   melongena). In the case of eggplant, fresh seeds frequently display
   dormancy and germination improves dramatically a few months after seed
   extraction. In order to test different treatment potentially useful to
   remove dormancy of fresh seeds, eight different combinations (C1-C8) of
   seven factors were tested on fresh seeds (less than two months from
   harvest) of the H15 variety. The seven factors evaluated included: (i)
   soaking of seeds, (ii) scarification with sodium hypochlorite (NaClO),
   (iii) application of gibberellic acid (GA3), (iv) use of potassium
   nitrate (KNO3) as a moistening agent, (v) cold stratification, (vi)
   application of a heat shock, and (vii) light irradiation during
   germination. Two germination parameters, early germination and 7 d
   germination rate, were recorded. Out of the eight treatments tested, the
   one consisting in application of soaking, GA3, KNO3, and heat shock (C6)
   resulted in a 100% germination rate in just three days. Other
   combinations wich dramatically improved germination over the control
   included C8 (soaking, NaClO, KNO3 and light), C5 (soaking, GA3, cold and
   light), and C2 (KNO3, cold, heat and light). The ANOVA analysis of the
   treatments' simple effects in the different combinations, showed that on
   average, soaking, KNO3, and light during germination had significant
   positive effects on germination, whereas NaClO and cold had significant
   negative effects. GA3 and the heat shock treatments did not show a
   significant effect on germination. Based on the results the C6
   combination is recommended for rapid germination of fresh seeds, and on
   the basis of the simple effects we propose testing an easy and
   inexpensive combination consisting of soaking, KNO3 and light.

   for germination were evaluated though alternating light/dark and
   continuous darkness conditions. Germination percentage (%G), germination
   speed index (GSI), mean germination time (MGT), % normal seedlings, %
   non germinated seeds, mean dry weight of seedlings, and light-relative
   germination index were evaluated. No germination occurred in T1, and in
   T2 it was irrelevant. T3 presented significant differences in all the
   variables studied; stratification for 4 months was the best to overcome
   dormancy. As light is not a determining factor in germination, this
   species is classified as neutral photoblastic.
X4 Se evaluaron métodos para superar la dormición y determinar las

   Medio Germinación Máxima (TMG), % Plántulas Normales, % Semillas sin

   T3 produjo diferencias altamente significativas en todas las variables
   analizadas, siendo el período de 4 meses de estratificación el mejor
   para romper la dormición. Al no ser la luz un factor determinante en la

AB Background: Flavonoids can protect plants against extreme temperatures
   and ROS due to their antioxidant activities. We found that deep-purple
   seed coat color was controlled by two gene interaction (12:3:1) from the
   cross between yellow and deep-purple seed coat colored inbreds. F-2:3
   seeds were grouped in 3 by seed coat color and germinated under chilling
   (4 degrees C) and non-acclimated conditions (18 degrees C) for a week,
   followed by normal conditions (18 degrees C) for three weeks and a
   subsequent chilling stress (4 degrees C) induction. We analyzed mean
   daily germination in each group. Additionally, to study the acclimation
   in relationship to the different seed coat colors on the germination
   ability and seedling performances under the cold temperatures, we
   measured the chlorophyll content, ROS scavenging activity, and
   expression levels of genes involved in ROS scavenging, flavonoid
   biosynthetic pathway, and cold response in seedlings.
   Results: The results of seed color segregation between yellow and deep
   purple suggested a two-gene model. In the germination study, normal
   environmental conditions induced the germination of yellow-seed, while
   under chilling conditions, the germination ratio of deep purple-seed was
   higher than that of yellow-colored seeds. We also found that the darker
   seed coat colors were highly responsive to cold acclimation based on the
   ROS scavenging enzymes activity and gene expression of ROS scavenging
   enzymes, flavonoid biosynthetic pathway and cold responsive genes.
   Conclusions: We suggest that deep purple colored seed might be in a
   state of innate pre-acquired stress response state under normal
   conditions to counteract stresses in a more effective way. Whereas,
   after the acclimation, another stress should enhance the cold genes
   expression response, which might result in a more efficient chilling
   stress response in deep purple seed seedlings.
   Low temperature has a large impact on the yield of crops. Thus,
   understanding the benefit of seed coat color response to chilling stress
   and the identification of limiting factors are useful for developing
   breeding strategies in order to improve the yield of wheat under
   chilling stress.

AB Cold tolerance (CT) of 31 tomato accessions (cultivars, breeding lines,
   and plant introductions) representing six Lycopersicon L. sp. was
   evaluated during seed germination and vegetative growth. Seed
   germination was evaluated under temperature regimes of 11 +/- 0.5
   degreesC (cold stress) and 20 +/- 0.5 degreesC (control) in petri plates
   containing 0.8% agar medium and maintained in darkness. Cold tolerance
   during seed germination was defined as the inverse of the ratio of
   germination time under cold stress to germination time under control
   conditions and referred to as germination tolerance index (TIG). Across
   accessions, TIG ranged from 0.15 to 0.48 indicating the presence of
   genotypic variation for CT during germination. Vegetative growth was
   evaluated in growth chambers with 12 h days/l2 h nights of 12/5 degreesC
   (cold stress) and 25/18 degreesC (control) with a 12 h photoperiod of
   350 mmol.m(-2).s(-1) (photosynthetic photon flux). Cold tolerance during
   vegetative growth was defined as the ratio of shoot dry weight (DW)
   under cold stress (DWS) to shoot DW under control (DWC) conditions and
   referred to as vegetative growth tolerance index (TIVG). Across
   accessions, TIVG ranged from 0.12 to 0.39 indicating the presence of
   genotypic variation for CT during vegetative growth. Cold tolerance
   during vegetative growth was independent of plant vigor, as judged by
   the absence of a significant correlation (r=0.14,P>0.05) between TIVG
   and DWC. Furthermore, CT during vegetative growth was independent of CT
   during seed germination, as judged by the absence of a significant rank
   correlation (r(R) = 0.14, P > 0.05) between TIVG and TIG. A few
   accessions, however, were identified with CT during both seed
   germination and vegetative growth. Results indicate that for CT breeding
   in tomato, each stage of plant development may have to be evaluated and
   selected for separately.

AB Seed from 27 Dwarf birch (Betula glandulosa Michx.) shrubs were
   collected from the one remaining B. glandulosa population in New
   Brunswick. Average initial germination was 69% for the 27 shrubs,
   ranging between 38 to 96%, and the mean germination time (MGT) in days
   was 5.8. Stratification (seed imbibed with water 5 degrees C in the dark
   for 3 weeks) did not improve germination or decrease the MGT, suggesting
   that the seed was not initially dormant. Seed from a selection of 7
   shrubs tolerated 2-week low temperature treatments to -20, -80 and -196
   degrees C and a 1-year -196 degrees C treatment. The -196 degrees
   Ctreated seed appeared to develop dormancy. Non-stratified -196 degrees
   C treated seed germination averaged 30% for the 7 shrubs, and
   germination increased to 67% with stratification and was not
   significantly different from the germination of the control seed. The
   MGT decreased in the stratified -196 degrees C treated seeds as compared
   to the non-stratified -196 degrees C seed. In the -20 and -80 degrees C
   2-week treated seed stratification decreased germination and increased
   MGT. Seed from the 27 shrubs tolerated storage for up to 6 years at 5
   degrees C, with only 2 shrubs (shrub 1 and 19) exhibited a significant
   decrease in germination ion after 6 years. The MGT significantly
   increased in all seed 6 years after storage, suggesting that seed
   deterioration was occurring and the seed was reaching their maximum
   storage potential.

AB Great Basin native plant communities are being replaced by the annual
   invasive cheatgrass Bromus tectorum. Cheatgrass exhibits a germination
   syndrome that is characteristic of facultative winter annuals. Although
   perennials dominate these communities, native annuals are present at
   many sites. Germination timing is often an important predictor of
   competitive interactions, and might determine whether the use of annual
   species in restoration efforts will be successful. I used a laboratory
   experiment to determine whether a suite of native annuals exhibit winter
   or spring annual germination syndromes. Seeds of Amsinckia menziesii
   var. intermedia, Amsinckia tesselata, Blepharipappus scaber, Descurainia
   pinnata, Eriastrum sparsiflorum, Lappula occidentalis, Mentzelia
   veatchiana and Plagiobothrys tenellus were tested for dormancy, and for
   responsiveness to light, cold stratification and dry after-ripening.
   Species that would be expected to be most similar to cheatgrass are
   those that have no requirement for cold stratification and are therefore
   likely to germinate under autumn or winter conditions. The species that
   clearly met this criterion in this laboratory study were A. menziesii
   var. intermedia, A. tesselata, D. pinnata and L. occidentalis. In
   contrast, B. scaber, E. sparsiflorum, M. veatchiana and P. tenellus had
   their highest germination after cold stratification and would be
   expected to be spring germinators. Blepharipappus scaber was not coaxed
   out of dormancy to a great degree by any of the treatments I applied and
   may exhibit cue-non-responsive dormancy. Field seed burial experiments,
   as well as experiments examining the competitive ability of these
   annuals versus cheatgrass will further inform us about their potential
   for success in restoration seedings.

AB Given the importance of early cold tolerance in maize (Zea mays L.), we
   previously conducted a divergent selection for low (L) and high (H) cold
   tolerance at germination. The source population was the F-2 of B73 x
   IABO78 single cross. Selection was first conducted as recurrent
   selection (four cycles) and then in inbreeding (three generations). Ten
   lines were finally selected for L and ten for H; these lines were then
   evaluated to investigate: (i) their field cold tolerance in the early
   autotrophic phase and the relationship with the cold tolerance expressed
   at emergence and in the heterotrophic phase; (ii) the inheritance of
   these cold tolerance traits; (iii) their agronomic performance as lines
   per se and as crosses; (iv) their SNP-based genetic characterization.
   For all cold tolerance traits, the H group of lines was superior to the
   L group; selection responses were often symmetric, suggesting the
   prevalence of additive effects. The relationship among cold tolerance
   traits was appreciable, suggesting a common genetic basis. Differences
   among testcrosses were largely due to general combining ability effects
   and the relationship between line per se and testcross performance was
   high, confirming the prevalence of additive effects. Correlated
   responses were also obtained for agronomic traits, the H lines being
   superior to L lines both per se and as crosses. For SNP-marker loci, the
   B73 allelic frequency was greater in the H group (61.7 %) than in L
   group (39.7 %). Across field trials, an H line excelled for all traits,
   thus proving to deserve further investigations.

AB Seed germination capability of Adonis distorta, Androsace mathildae,
   Aquilegia magellensis and Campanula fragilis subsp. cavolinii endemic
   species of the Central Apennines (Italy) were analyzed. Seed traits
   varied significantly among the considered species. In particular, seed
   volume was the largest in Adonis (91.642 +/- 16.851 mm(3)) and the
   lowest in Campanula (0.029 +/- 0.008 mm3). The seed coat thickness
   ranged from 31 +/- 10 mu m in Adonis to 9 +/- 1 mu m in Campanula.
   Pretreatments were carried out to improve seed germination. Seed
   germination did not happen in Adonis and Androsace in response to the
   applied treatments (i.e., 0, 250, 500 ppm gibberelic acid, GA3) and the
   cold-wet stratification. A 65% increase of germination was observed
   after the pre-treatment with 500 ppm GA3 in Aquilegia which could be
   justified by an endogenous non-deep physiological dormancy. The final
   germination percentage increased by 26% in Aquilegia and decreased by
   89% in Campanula after the cold-wet stratification treatment. The
   obtained results were used to define germination protocols which could
   be used in reinforcement projects for the wild populations of the
   considered endemic species as a means of reducing their extinction risk.

AB Purpose: To determine whether pretreatment CT texture features can
   improve patient risk stratification beyond conventional prognostic
   factors (CPFs) in stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
   Methods and Materials: We retrospectively reviewed 91 cases with stage
   III NSCLC treated with definitive chemoradiation therapy. All patients
   underwent pretreatment diagnostic contrast enhanced computed tomography
   (CE-CT) followed by 4-dimensional CT (4D-CT) for treatment simulation.
   We used the average-CT and expiratory (T50-CT) images from the 4D-CT
   along with the CE-CT for texture extraction. Histogram, gradient,
   co-occurrence, gray tone difference, and filtration-based techniques
   were used for texture feature extraction. Penalized Cox regression
   implementing cross-validation was used for covariate selection and
   modeling. Models incorporating texture features from the 33 image types
   and CPFs were compared to those with models incorporating CPFs alone for
   overall survival (OS), local-regional control (LRC), and freedom from
   distant metastases (FFDM). Predictive Kaplan-Meier curves were generated
   using leave-one-out cross-validation. Patients were stratified based on
   whether their predicted outcome was above or below the median.
   Reproducibility of texture features was evaluated using test-retest
   scans from independent patients and quantified using concordance
   correlation coefficients (CCC). We compared models incorporating the
   reproducibility seen on test-retest scans to our original models and
   determined the classification reproducibility.
   Results: Models incorporating both texture features and CPFs
   demonstrated a significant improvement in risk stratification compared
   to models using CPFs alone for OS (P = .046), LRC (P = .01), and FFDM (P
   = .005). The average CCCs were 0.89, 0.91, and 0.67 for texture features
   extracted from the average-CT, T50-CT, and CE-CT, respectively.
   Incorporating reproducibility within our models yielded 80.4% (+/- 3.7%
   SD), 78.3% (+/- 4.0% SD), and 78.8% (+/- 3.9% SD) classification
   reproducibility in terms of OS, LRC, and FFDM, respectively.
   Conclusions: Pretreatment tumor texture may provide prognostic
   information beyond that obtained from CPFs. Models incorporating feature
   reproducibility achieved classification rates of similar to 80%.
   External validation would be required to establish texture as a
   prognostic factor. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB The combination of gibberellin acid (GA) soaking with moist chilling
   plays a pivotal role in seed dormancy breaking. However, knowledge
   involving physiological and biochemical mechanisms for such a response
   is limited. This work focused on the effects of GA(3) and moist chilling
   on overcoming seed dormancy as well as the response of endogenous
   hormones and nutrient reserves to dormancy release in Chinese dogwood
   (Cornus kousa var. chinensis). Seeds subjected to GA(3) soaking and
   moist chilling exhibited a high germination percentage (average 97%),
   and the combination of 500 mg.L-1 GA(3) soaking for 3 days followed with
   moist chilling for 50 days was more effective than other treatments. For
   GA(3) treatments, lipids were initially hydrolyzed during the first
   stage of moist chilling (0-20 days), resulting in the increase of starch
   and soluble sugars, while proteins were kept relatively stable. During
   the second stage (20-50 days), contents of lipids, starch, soluble
   sugars, and proteins decreased by 46%, 82%, 61% and 59%, respectively.
   Abscisic acid (ABA) contents and ratios of ABA to GA(3) in GA(3)
   treatments decreased by nearly 70% and over 90%, respectively, when
   dormancy was terminated. However, endogenous GA(3) contents in all
   treatments significantly increased with prolonged moist chilling. The
   present results provide insight into the metabolic mechanism involving
   hormonal regulation and mobilization of reserves during the release of
   seed dormancy in Chinese dogwood.

AB Current knowledge suggests that the mechanisms by which plants
   communicate information take numerous forms. Previous studies have
   focussed their attention on communication via chemicals, contact and
   light; other methods of interaction between plants have remained
   speculative. In this study we tested the ability of young chilli plants
   to sense their neighbours and identify their relatives using alternative
   mechanism(s) to recognised plant communication pathways. We found that
   the presence of a neighbouring plant had a significant influence on seed
   germination even when all known sources of communication signals were
   blocked. Furthermore, despite the signalling restriction, seedlings
   allocated energy to their stem and root systems differently depending on
   the identity of the neighbour. These results provide clear experimental
   evidence for the existence of communication channels between plants
   beyond those that have been recognized and studied thus far.

AB Fluctuating and extreme changes in temperature during seed germination
   may disrupt several physiological processes. Developing easy and
   reliable screening techniques to identify cultivar tolerance to extreme
   temperatures would benefit crop breeding programs in selecting cultivars
   for niche environments. An experiment was conducted to study the
   influence of temperature on 12 ornamental pepper cultivars using in
   vitro seed germination parameters. Time-series seed germination
   responses at a range of temperatures from 10 to 45 degrees C with 5
   degrees C increments were carried out and number of germinated seed
   recorded every six hours. Seed germination rate (SGR) and maximum seed
   germination (MSG) were derived from temperature and germination
   time-course data by fitting a three-parameter sigmoidal function.
   Quadratic and bilinear functions best described SGR- and MSG-temperature
   response functions, respectively. Cumulative temperature response
   indices (CTRI) of each cultivar, calculated as the sum of eight
   individual temperature response indices derived from temperature
   adaptability range (TAR = T-max to T-min), T-min, T-opt, and T-max, for
   SGR and MSG, were used to classify cultivars for temperature tolerance.
   Cultivars were classified based on CTRI(heat) as heat tolerant ('Medusa'
   and 'Treasures Red'), heat intermediate ('Thai Hot', 'Variegata', and
   'Red Missile'), and heat sensitive ('Purple Flash', 'Salsa Yellow',
   'Black Pearl', 'Chilly Chili', 'Explosive Ember', 'Calico', and
   'Sangria'). Similarly, cultivars were classified for cold tolerance as
   cold sensitive, moderately cold sensitive, moderately cold tolerant and
   cold tolerant based on CTRI(cold). Screening based on seed germination
   parameters is a simple and inexpensive method for determining vegetative
   temperature tolerance in pepper breeding programs.

AB Arnebia benthamii (Wall. ex G.Don.) Johnst., Boraginaceae, is an
   important Himalayan alpine herb with tremendous medicinal properties.
   The species is facing the pressure of overexploitation and is ranked as
   a critically endangered species. In an effort to develop a strategy to
   conserve and cultivate the species, the present study of in vitro seed
   germination was carried out. The study depicted that the seeds have a
   very high viability (98%) and contain oil as the reserve food material.
   The seeds imbibe water nicely and there is no physical dormancy imposed
   by the seed coat. Among the many pretreatments used to increase
   percentage germination and reducing mean germination time (MGT),
   scarification (seed coat removal) proved most effective. The
   scarification treatment enhanced seed germination to 96.66% and reduced
   mean germination time to 4.03 days, followed by Kinetin (50 ppm) with
   90.83% seed germination and MGT of 4.15 days, as against control, with
   31.66% germination and MGT of 9.18 days. Furthermore, when the scarified
   seeds were treated with seed coat extract, the percentage germination
   depleted drastically to 28.33% which is suggestive of the fact that the
   seed coat contains the chemical inhibitors which do have a regulatory or
   inhibitory effect on seed germination. The study also revealed that the
   seeds do not need chilling for witnessing germination.

AB In order to investigate how salicylic acid (SA) priming affect the
   physiological indexes of maize seed (embryo, endosperm and seed coat)
   during seed imbibition under low temperature, maize hybrid Zhengdan 958
   was used as materials in this study, and the seeds were primed with 0.1
   mmol/L SA for 36 h, subsequently manipulated by imbibition duration for
   0, 12, 24, 36, 48 h under 15°C respectively. The results indicated that
   SA priming significantly increased seed germination rate. The nucleic
   acid content in seed leakage decreased at first and then increased with
   prolonged imbibition time. Similarly, the soluble sugar content of
   embryo decreased at first and then increased. While POD activity of
   endosperm gradually increased, and CAT activity of seed coat increased
   at first and then decreased. Compared with no primed seed, during the
   majority of seed imbibition time, SA priming treatment could
   significantly increase the soluble sugar content of endosperm and seed
   coat, improve the soluble protein content of embryo and seed coat,
   enhance the CAT and POD activity of endosperm and seed coat, decline the
   nucleic acid content in seed leakage, and thus strengthen the resistance
   of maize seed to chilling stress.

AB The quantity and stability of soil organic matter (SOM) associated with
   soil aggregates are affected by tillage management, which can be
   characterized potentially using the technique of thermal analysis. In
   this study, we evaluated the concentration and thermal stability of SOM
   occulted with various aggregate classes under no-tillage (NT) and
   moldboard plow (MP) treatments using thermogravimetry (TG) and
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Soil samples were collected 10
   yr after tillage experiment was started. The results showed that
   conversion from MP to NT significantly increased SOM concentration and
   the proportion of large macro-aggregates (>2 mm) in the 0- to 5-cm soil
   layer. For all aggregate classes the derivatives of thermogravimetry
   curves (DTG) had three weight loss peaks near 100, 350, and 500 degrees
   C, and one endothermic peak and three exothermic peaks in the DSC
   curves. No differences in ignition temperature, peak position, and
   ending temperature of SOM combustion were observed between tillage
   treatments and among the soil layers. For both tillage systems, the
   proportion of thermal labile SOM (weight loss in 200-400 degrees C
   accounting for that in 200-550 degrees C, Exo(1)/Exo(tot)) and energy
   densities (ED) of SOM (energy release per unit SOM) declined with
   decreasing aggregate size in the 0- to 20-cm soil layer. Moreover,
   TG-T-50 (the temperature resulting in 50% of SOM loss) correlated
   negatively to aggregate size, but DSC-T-50 (the temperature at which 50%
   of energy resulting from organic matter combustion release) correlated
   positively to aggregate size. Compared with MP management, NT management
   improved quantity but decreased thermal stability of SOM in aggregates
   in the 0-to 5-cm layer, which was indicated by the greater weight loss
   at combustion, higher Exo(1)/Exo(tot) ratio, greater energy densities
   and lower TG-T-50. No tillage also led to increased stratification
   ratios of thermal labile and thermal recalcitrant SOM.

AB The purpose of this study was to determine whether Cercis chinensis
   seeds contain endogenous germination inhibitors, and if so, to clarify
   the dynamic changes to the inhibitors during dormancy release. A cabbage
   seed germination test was conducted to assess the seed extract
   activities during dormancy release. The endogenous inhibitor components
   were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and the dynamic
   changes to the endogenous inhibitors were analyzed by high-performance
   liquid chromatography. The analyses revealed 1,2,3-benzenetriol
   (phenolic compound) in the seedcoat is a water-soluble endogenous
   inhibitor, and the IC50 (the concentration at which 1,2,3-benzenetriol
   inhibited radicle growth of cabbage seeds by 50%) of 1,2,3-benzenetriol
   was 51.2 mu g.mL(-1). During dormancy release, the seed
   1,2,3-benzenetriol content decreased to 17.7 mu g.mL(-1) (stratified for
   60 days) from 561.4 mu g.mL(-1) (control). The abscisic acid (ABA)
   content exhibited the same tendency, decreasing from 5.6 ng.mL(-1) to
   0.5 ng.mL(-1) after 60-day stratification. Exogenous ABA was highly
   inhibitory toward cabbage seed germination, with an IC50 of 1.5
   ng.mL(-1). These results indicate that ABA and 1,2,3-benzenetriol are
   important endogenous inhibitors in C. chinensis seeds, wherein they
   regulate seed dormancy, even at low concentrations.

   from controlled pollinations performed in 2002. Germination time for
   seeds with mesocarp and endocarp removed was recorded during
   stratification, and time of leaf budbreak and flowering were recorded in
   the fourth and fifth leaf. Within the six progenies evaluated over two
   years, correlations between seed germination and leaf budbreak of the

   0.48. Correlations between seed germination and seedling flowering time
   ranged between 0.06 and 0.55, and for the pooled data were 0.50. These
   indicate a relationship between times of germination of the seeds and
   flowering of the resulting seedlings, and so if breeders generate a
   large number of fruits per cross where they expect important segregation
   of the flowering time, selection of the seeds that take longer to
   germinate will be translated into a certain degree of delay of the

AB Habanero pepper (Capsicum chinense Jacq.) seeds decrease their
   germination after storage periods exceeding 100 d. Pre-sowing
   treatments, reinvigorate, accelerate and uniform seed germination of the
   genus Capsicum. In this study habanero pepper seeds were pre-treated
   during 144 h with constant aeration in distilled water and aqueous
   solutions (treatments) of: KNO3 at 3 %, polyethylene glycol (PEG) at
   -0.5 MPa, abscisic acid (ABA) at 10(-5) M and gibberellic acid (GA(3))
   at 400 ppm. After pre-sowing treatments, seeds were germinated in petri
   dishes and trays (the control was sown without pre-treatment). The
   experimental design was a completely randomized, the data were used to
   perform ANOVA and means were compared using Tukey test (p <= 0.05).
   Results showed that seeds treated with ABA (13.22 % of germinated seeds
   d(-1)) increased germination rate compared with the control (6.38 % of
   germinated seeds d(-1)) and all pre-sowing treatments increased the
   germination percentage (%G), but not all of them maintained that
   increase during emergence. In emergence percentage (%E) only PEG and
   KNO3 treatments (osmotic) were statistically different from the control
   surpassing it at 36 and 21 %. Osmotic treatments avoided protrusion
   during the pre-sowing treatment and their %E was similar to %G. The
   pre-sowing treatment of seeds is optimal if germination and emergence is
   increased; therefore the presowing treatment of habanero pepper seeds
   with KNO3, PEG and ABA is more appropriate to increase seedling
   establishment.

   breaking treatment in Tulipa scardica and T. kosovarica seeds by
   pre-chilling and various concentration of potassium nitrate (KNO3),

   experiment was conducted with untreated seeds (without stratification)
   and with stratified seeds (8 weeks) and treated with different
   concentration of some chemicals and plant growth regulators. Results
   showed that the final germination percentage (FGP) of seeds without
   stratification at both Tulipa plant species was zero, while germination
   was enhanced by pre-chilling (stratification) especially after treatment
   of these seeds by above mentioned treatments. Both Tulipa species showed
   an increase in mean germination time (MGT), an indication of slower
   germination, as different chemicals or plant growth regulators
   increased. Depending on treatments, germination was ranging from 80% to
   90%, the maximum germination was detected in seeds treated with KNO3,
   GA3, and their combination, while the minimum germination in seeds
   without treatments and treated with thiourea. The conservation of these
   plants in botanic gardens by cultivation or propagation for commercial
   use as ornamental plants could give an effective contribution to the
   conservation of these plants. Abbreviations: KNO3 - potassium nitrate;

   treatments such as scarification and low temperature stratification
   (4°C) on seed germination and early seedling development of TMS 98/0505
   and NR 87184 is not well known. Thus, the objective of this study was to
   determine the effect of non-scarification (control), scarification alone
   and scarification + low temperature stratification (4°C) on germination
   percentage and early seedling development of two cassava hybrids (TMS
   98/0505 and NR 87184). The seeds were collected 7 months after harvest
   at brown dry-fruit stage and given one of the three treatments. Results
   showed that the combination of scarification and low temperature (4°C)
   stratification increased radicle germination by 10% in TMS 98/0505 and
   7% in NR 87184 while germination was only 3% in the control. In both
   hybrids, plumule emergence was at least doubled by the application of
   scarification and low temperature stratification compared to the
   control. Emergence speed index (ESI), and radicle length were fastest
   and longest respectively in the low temperature stratification treatment
   (particularly in TMS 98/0505) and slowest/shortest in the control. This
   study has shown that the application of low temperature stratification
   on scarified seeds increases germination rate of dormant cassava
   hybrids. It also suggests that the low seed germination percentage
   observed may be caused by dormancy due to a combination of seed coat and
   embryo (physiological) factors. Every increase in germination would
   promote propagation through seed as well as enhance rate of cassava
   improve through convention breeding. Potentially more effective method
   of scarifying and stratifying these seeds for greater impact are
   suggested herein.

AB In this study, the effectiveness of different pre-treatment methods for

   assessed. Viable seeds were randomly sampled and subjected to different
   pre-treatment methods which include filing, soaking in 98% concentrated
   sulphuric acid, pre-chilling and boiling. For each treatment, ten seeds
   were used and three replications were done for each treatment. The
   investigation revealed that filing enhances seed germination and seed
   dormancy is likely due to the hard seed coat which has to be weakened or
   broken gently to avoid embryo damage, thus facilitating germination.
   Although, filing caused seeds to germinate, the mean germination rate of
   13.3% that was achieved is too low to make this investigation
   conclusive. Further studies similar to this are recommended to improve
   the germination rate to higher than 30%.

AB Kelussia odoratissima Mozaff belonging to the Apiaceae family, is well
   known for its medicinal and nutritional importance, endemic to Iran.
   Seed dormancy is a major problem present in Kelussia odoratissima
   leading to low germination percentage; thus, improvement of seed
   germination and breaking seed dormancy is important. Piriformospora
   indica, a root-colonizing endophytic fungus, promotes plant growth,
   development and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. In order to
   evaluate the effects of different treatments of P. indica on seed
   germination traits of Kelussia odoratissima, an experiment was conducted
   based on completely randomized design with five treatments and three
   replications. The experimental treatments were application of fungal
   mycelium of P. indica (M), spore suspension of P. indica (S), the
   combination of Gibberellic acid and fungal mycelium (H+M), the
   combination of Gibberellic acid and spore suspension (H+S), and control
   (C). Based on the results the highest percentage of germination (75%)
   and the highest germination rate was related to spore suspension of P.
   indica. The lowest amount of germination uniformity (GU) observed in
   spore suspension of P. indica treatment. Among the different treatments,
   application of P. indica spore suspension resulted in lowest times for
   10% germination (D-10) and 90% germination (D-90). The highest plumule
   and radicle length observed in spore treatment and in comparison with
   control, application of spore suspension of P. indica increased plumule
   and radicle length by 16% and 32%, respectively. Based on the current
   results, it seems that spore suspension of P. indica was the best
   treatment for improvement of seed germination traits.

AB Introduction: Indian Cheese Maker, an herbage plant, belongs to potatoes
   family and grows in areas such as Pakistan, Afghanistan, India and Iran.
   Given its medicinal properties, Indian Cheese Maker plays an important
   role in traditional Iranian medicine. Lack of dormancy is one of the
   most desirable agronomic characteristics of its seeds, which is
   necessary to achieve the highest amount of germination, emergence and
   plant establishment. Seed germination capacity of medicinal herbs is
   typically low, which is due to the presence of seed dormancy in these
   plants. Material and Methods: This study was conducted to evaluate the
   effect of disinfection and pre-chilling on germination and enzymatic
   properties of different Indian cheese maker landraces. The experiment
   was conducted as a factorial based on a completely randomized design
   with three replications during 2015-16 at the Laboratory of the
   Department of Agronomy, Tarbiat Modares University. Two treatments
   consisting of seeds disinfected at two levels (no application and 30 min
   with hypochlorite solution 5%), two pre-chilling treatments (no
   application and 1 week pre-chilling) and four Indian cheese maker
   landraces (Fanuj, Khash, Saravan and Sarbaz) were the experimental
   factors. For the purpose of suitable pre-chilling to activate the
   germination enzymes, the seeds were placed in a coated container, on an
   aluminum foil with holes in it, without direct contact and close to
   distilled water at 4°C. 25 seeds were placed in each sterile petri dish
   with Watten filter paper 42. Five ml of distilled water was added to
   each petri. After applying the treatments, the petri dishes were covered
   with parafilm and were placed in a germinator at 25°C in the light for
   14 days. Results: The results showed that in the Fanuj, Khash and
   Saravan landraces, the highest values of final germination percentage,
   germination rate, mean daily germination and mean time germination were
   obtained during disinfection of 30 minutes and pre-chilling of one week.
   However, the Sarbaz landrace showed a reverse trend and indicated the
   highest values of these traits in non-application of seed disinfection
   and pre-chilling. In terms of the activity of germination enzymes, the
   highest values of alpha and beta amylase (0.74 and 0.59 mumol/ml/min)
   were obtained in the Fanuj landrace with 30-minute disinfection with
   sodium hypochlorite and one-week pre-chilling. Conclusion: According to
   the results, the Fenuj, Khash and Saravan landraces of Indian Cheese
   Maker showed positive reaction to disinfection with sodium hypochlorite
   for 30 minutes and pre-cooling for one week. The same treatments
   increased the properties and activity of germination enzymes. The Sarbaz
   landrace did not react positively to the treatments applied and reacted
   negatively in terms of the properties and activity of germination
   enzymes. The reason for this behavior in the Sarbaz landrace could be
   attributed to lower annual rainfall, as well as higher temperature,
   which causes the hardening of the seed's cover and the increase in the
   values of germination inhibiting factors, creating seed dormancy, which
   allows it to survive hot and dry periods. Generally speaking, the use of
   sodium hypochlorite and pre-chilling can be recommended to break seed
   dormancy of most Indian Cheese Maker landraces.

AB Loranthus tanakae (Franch. & Sav.) is an endangered species of
   mistletoe, distributed in Korean peninsula. The objective of our
   research is to determine the effect of storage duration and conditions
   [air flow (AF) and air tight (AT)] at different temperatures for
   survivability and germination of mistletoe seeds, and also to monitor
   the effect of seed scarification on germination in vitro. The result
   revealed that the seeds stored in natural conditions (no stratification)
   showed highest survival rate of 100% and retained up to 93.3% even after
   two months of storage in natural conditions and showed higher
   germination percentage (90%) compare to after ripened seeds. However,
   the seed stored at 0Â°C decreased the germination percentage (ranged
   from 63 to 73%). Therefore, it can be confirmed that mistletoe does not
   need after ripened treatment to promote germination. Our research also
   showed that the storage of L. tanaka seeds in freezing temperatures of
   -20Â°C and in room temperature for long time either in AT or AF
   conditions caused the loss of survival and germination rate.On the other
   hand, the chemical scarification (0.01N HCl incubation for 12 hrs. at
   38Â°C) method was proven more effective to enhance germination
   percentage of L. tanakae. Regarding the temperature regime, 22Â°C showed
   early germination of mistletoe seeds in vitro.

   scoparia Spach, P. eleagnifolia Spach, P. lycioides Spach and P. dulcis
   Mill (No. 24 Zarghan) were collected and stratified at 41°C for 4 weeks.
   Stratified seeds were incubated in PEG solution with various osmotic
   potentials (0, -0.05, -0.1 and -0.5 MPa). The experiment was arranged in
   a completely randomized design with 4 replications, and germination
   capacity, mean and time of germination, germination rate, length of
   hypocotyls and radicles and also fresh and dry weight of seedlings were
   determined. Germination capacity, germination rate and growth parameters
   of all species were decreased by increase in PEG concentration and
   germination onset was also delayed. Furthermore the results indicated
   that osmotic stress depressed the hypocotyls growth more than radicle
   and root systems were more drought tolerant. Although PEG adversely
   affected the germination of all 4 species, they responded differently to
   drought stress. P. scoparia showing higher germination capacity,
   germination rate and seedling length had the highest tolerance to
   drought stress and P. eleagnifolia in early phase of its seedling growth
   could not completely cope with drought stress. The germination results
   revealed the presence of drought resistant almonds with rich germplasm
   in Iran.

AB Seeds of ten grain amaranth (Amaranthus spp.) were tested for their
   dormancy and viability. Freshly harvested seeds were dormant up to 2
   months. Only genotype IE- 42006 and GA-1 showed relatively higher
   germinability at 2 months of harvest. About 50% of seeds remained
   dormant up to 4 months of harvest in rest of the genotypes. After 6
   months of harvest, seeds of all the genotypes showed higher
   germinability above 70%. Seeds of all the genotypes showed more than 90%
   germination around 9 months of harvest except in GA-1 where decline in
   germination was noticed. By 18 months of harvest the seeds of all the
   genotypes lost their viability considerably. In genotype AG-21 and AG114
   relatively higher germinability (60%) was noticed up to 16 months of
   harvest. Dormancy of seeds could be successfully broken by chemical
   treatments like 200 ppm of gibberellic acid, ascorbic acid, or ethylene
   for 24 h and by physical treatments like hot water (70degreeC) for one
   minute, high temperature (50degreeC) for 12 h or stratification
   (4degreeC) for 7 days.

AB Aruncus dioicus (Walter) Fernald (Rosaceae) is a perennial herbaceous
   plant whose young shoots are traditionally collected in the wild and
   consumed as a food in NE Italy. The aim of this study was to determine
   the germination requirements of its seeds in order to start its
   cultivation, and to assess the germination of six accessions of the
   species. Viability of seeds ranged from 86 to 97% in the various
   accessions. Germination rate was almost null in seeds of two accessions,
   and ranged from 10.5 to 37.3 in the other ones. The seed coat was
   permeable to water. Treatments with GA(3), KNO3 and mechanical
   scarification did not enhance the germination, while the cold
   stratification treatment at 2 degrees C for different periods improved
   the germination rate and the mean germination time as compared with the
   untreated seeds. With 45 days of cold stratification, the germination
   rate and mean germination time (respectively, 90.1% and 7.7 dd) of seeds
   were different from those of the untreated seeds. Cold stratified seeds
   germinated under artificial light and did not germinate in the dark.
   Seeds of A. dioicus displayed an intermediate physiological dormancy,
   removable by a cold stratification treatment, requiring both light and
   cold conditions.

AB Seeds of high-mountain species are thought to germinate rapidly,
   synchronously and at high percentages after a cold period, with limited
   dependence on the external environment; yet, empirical evidence only
   partially supports this behaviour. We performed a comparative study of
   the germination response of two closely related taxa along an altitude
   gradient in northern Spain. Seeds from several maternal families of six
   populations of Saxifraga trifurcata (lowland species) and S.canaliculata
   (highland species) were subjected to temperature and stratification
   treatments. Germination percentages and germination rates were analysed
   using generalised linear mixed modelling and accelerated failure-time
   modelling. We found that germination percentages and germination rates
   were high and dependent on incubation temperature in both species.
   Within species, seeds from higher altitudes had higher germination
   percentages under all conditions. Coldwet stratification negatively
   affected germination success, particularly in the lowland species.
   Overall, the highland species was less responsive to the experimental
   treatments and showed more synchronous germination patterns. We conclude
   that seeds from these two Saxifraga species germinate as efficiently as
   species from other habitats, but have a narrower germination response,
   probably due to the stronger selective pressures in their harsh
   environments. Finally, a cold, wet stratification period is not a
   prerequisite for the germination of high-mountain S.canaliculata, and
   its strong negative effect on the germination of its lowland relative
   S.trifurcata may contribute to the altitudinal segregation of these two
   species.

AB Orthodox seeds may present differences in germination due to several
   reasons. In this work, we tested treatments for improving germination in
   two cultivars of common eggplant (Solanum melongena) and in six
   accessions of the related species S. macrocarpon, S. aethiopicum, and S.
   incanum. With the exception of S. incanum MM-557, which did not
   germinate, seeds of the other accessions directly had lower final
   germination percentages when sown in Petri dishes with deep filter paper
   than those that were pretreated by surface sterilization and sown in
   nutrient medium; a further increase in the final germination percentages
   was achieved by addition of 1 mg L-1 GA(3) to the medium. The
   GA(3)-pretreatment not only increased the final germination percentages
   but promoted germination also by reducing germination time. Other
   treatments included stratification of S. macrocarpon and S. aethiopicum
   seeds at 4 degrees C for 15 or 30 days, as well as addition of 1 mg L-1
   of TDZ and BAP for the BBS-168 accession, but this did not improve
   germination. The addition of 0.3 mg L-1 fluridone, an inhibitor of
   carotenoid biosynthesis, that is known to prevent ABA biosynthesis,
   increased the final germination percentages of S. melongena, S.
   aethiopicum and S. macrocarpon to a similar degree as GA(3). Seeds of S.
   incanum MM-557 did not respond to this treatment but the hybrid derived
   from this S. incanum accession with eggplant accession ANS-26 showed
   high germination percentages (70%, 13 days after sowing) in NM medium
   with GA(3), fluridone or both components. These results show that seed
   treatments can contribute to improving germination of Solanum accessions
   with low germination.

AB Chili (Capsicum chinense) cv. 'Bhut jalakia' is used in India for
   extraction of oleoresin and capsaicin as it is characterized by a very
   high capsaicin content. The conventional method of propagation of 'Bhut
   jalakia' is through seeds, but this is beset by short viability and low
   germination rates. Developing a suitable regeneration protocol for 'Bhut
   jalakia' was the focus of this study; as to date, in vitro regeneration
   for this cultivar has not been investigated. Cotyledon and shoot tip
   explants were cultured on Murashige and Skoog (MS) media supplemented
   with different concentrations of cytokinins and auxins. In the case of
   cotyledon explants, MS medium supplemented with 6-benzylaminopurine
   (BAP) at 35 mu M and kinetin (KIN) at 15 mu M were found to be optimal
   (4.00 +/- 0.57) for induction of multiple shoots per explant, whereas
   BAP at 14.8 mu M and KIN at 60 mu M were best (5.00 +/- 0.57) for growth
   of shoot tip explants. Shoots developed from cotyledon explants produced
   the maximum (8.67 +/- 0.32) number of roots on MS medium supplemented
   with low concentration (2.6 mu M) of 2-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA).
   Supplementation of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA) at 5 mu M was found
   optimal for root formation (16.67 +/- 2.60) for shoots derived from of
   shoot tip explants. One month after transfer of in vitro regenerated
   plantlets to various potting mixes, the highest survival rate (40%) was
   observed in a mixture of sand, soil, and cow dung in a ratio of 1:1:1.
   Thus, both shoot tip and cotyledon explants may be cultured on MS medium
   modified with BAP, IBA, NAA, and KIN to regenerate 'Bhut jalakia' chili
   plants within 90 d.

AB Bromus auleticus is a cool season perennial C3 grass, recognised as a
   forage plant genetic resource and used for native grasslands
   restoration. It is native to the campos biome, found in southern Brazil,
   Uruguay and central Argentina. Its forage yield is comparable with tall
   fescue. Seed dormancy is a problem to evaluate germination and for
   commercialisation of this species. Using four recently harvested seed
   lots of three different genotypes, we tested six different treatments to
   release dormancy: a control (mean germination 52%); 0.05 and 0.1%
   gibberellic acid; KNO3; pre-chilling + KNO3; and pre-chilling (mean
   germination across seed lots and treatments, 87%). Pre-chilling + KNO3
   and pre-chilling were the best treatments to break dormancy, with mean
   germination times (MGT) reduced to half (8.7 and 9.3 days(-1)) that of
   the untreated control (19.2 days(-1)). The treatment with KNO3 alone did
   not yield uniform results across seed lots; when combined with
   pre-chilling, final germination did not increase but showed more
   consistent results. The use of 0.05% gibberellic acid was less efficient
   than pre-chilling to reduce the MGT of 17.2 days(-1), but it could be
   considered as an alternative treatment for seed lots in which the
   germination results are needed fast and has the additional advantages of
   avoiding exposing seeds to cold stress. Furthermore, if seeds are
   contaminated with fungi, it reduces growth time and contamination
   effects.

AB We are interested in obtaining rootstocks from seedlings of different
   Actinidia species such as Actinidia chinensis, Actinidia arguta and
   Actinidia eriantha, but the literature about kiwifruit seed germination
   is scarce and generally reports poor germination rates. The aim of this
   work was to establish what factors are critical to kiwifruit seed
   germination. Germination is a very complex process, controlled by
   multiple factors including temperature, dormancy, water availability,
   and light. The use of cold temperatures, or plant growth regulators (
   gibberellins) to substitute the chilling requirements, to break
   kiwifruit seed dormancy has been already described. Here, several
   factors such as cold stratification (time and type of treatment) and
   thermo-photoperiod conditions were tested. Response parameters
   percentage of seed germination (%G), mean germination time (MGT), and
   germination index (GI) were calculated. In this study, we present
   results from A. chinensis var. deliciosa `Summer' in order to show how
   neural networks can be useful to decipher key factors of the germination
   process. Neurofuzzy logic models simplify data analysis and point out
   the critical role of cold stratification time ( long periods at 4
   degrees C) and stratification treatment (using gibberellic acid) on
   kiwifruit seed germination.

AB We examined the effect of pretreatments on seed germination, seedling
   growth, optimal seedling density of Phellodendron amurense. The seeds
   were carefully purified after collection in late Oct. from natural
   population at Mt. Chiri. For the evaluation of pretreatment effects,
   seeds were sowed in an experimental nursery after being stored in open
   ground (2apprx8degree C) with soaking in 20% H2O2, 50-fold pon-pon
   solution, cold moist stratification in refrigerator(2apprx4degree C) and
   dry storage in room temperature (4 apprx18degree C), respectively. For
   the effect of growth density of seedlings, seedlings germinated in
   nursery were precisely controlled with 53, 104, 220, 380 seedlings per
   m2. Among pretreatments for the promotion of germination rate, pon-pon
   treatment (68.8%) was highest, the others were higher than that in dry
   storage (2.3%), and these seed pretreatment methods were significantly
   different at 1% level. The height growth of seedlings showed the most
   vigor from Jun.12 to Jul. 8, and from Jul. 20 to Aug. 2, and it reached
   to 72.8% of height growth. In case of 1-0 seedling, although seedling
   density per m2 was increased, seedling growth was decreased. The optimal
   seedling density was 104 seedlings per m2. The standard seedlings for
   plantation were above height 55cm, root collar diameter 8.1mm, and root
   length 21cm. These results demonstrated that seed of P. amurense
   requires stratification for the germination promotion.

   Phleum pratense cv. Bartovia seeds from 1982-87 harvests were stored at
   ambient temperature and relative humidity and tested in 1988. Imbibing
   seeds in 10 M GA3 solution increased the percentage of viable seeds; 5 M
   kinetin was less effective. Germination rate determined after 5-7 d was
   greatly increased by chilling or imbibing seeds in solutions of GA3,
   kinetin or their mixture. Addition of 0.2% KNO3 gave further increases.
   Germination rate remained low in the oldest P. pratense seeds. Effects
   on seed vigour varied with seed age. Infusing seeds in acetone solutions
   of the growth regulators had little or no effect on their quality.

AB The aim of the study was to shorten the period of breaking dormancy in
   apple seeds and to improve the growth of the seedlings of 'Gold
   Milenium', 'Ligol' and Szampion'. The whole seeds were removed from
   fruits directly after the harvest and were subjected to stratification
   (3 degrees C for 90 days in darkness) in distilled water or an aqueous
   solutions of 500 mM salicylic acid (SA), 10(-3) M jasmonic acid (JA),
   gibberellin A(3) (GA(3)) and 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) at 250 mg.dm(-3)
   and 100 mg.dm(-3), respectively. Growth regulators were applied
   separately or in a mixture containing SA, JA, GA(3) and BAP. The
   germinability and seed germination rate, seedlings growth, chlorophyll
   content index and the maximum quantum efficiency of Photosystem II
   (Fv/Fm) were investigated. The obtained results revealed that
   stratification in water positively affected the dormancy removal in
   'Gold Milenium', 'Ligol' and Szampion' seeds. Application of SA, GA(3),
   BAP, JA during seed stratification additionally stimulated the seeds'
   germination rate as well as the growth of seedlings, index of
   chlorophyll content and maximum PSII efficiency (Fv/Fm). The most
   pronounced results were obtained after the seed stratification in GA(3)
   alone or in a mixture containing SA, GA(3), BAP and JA. Due to such a
   treatment, the germination of 'Ligol' seeds increased by 40% and they
   germinated faster in comparison to the control seeds. Such treatments
   also promoted the growth of seedlings, chlorophyll content and maximum
   quantum efficiency of Photosystem II (Fv/Fm). The present study
   indicates that the application of GA(3) or the mixture of SA, GA(3), BAP
   and JA during the stratification of seeds is an effective method to
   increase and accelerate the germination of seeds and juvenile seedlings'
   growth in order to shorten the apple breeding cycle. Further studies are
   needed to optimize the appropriate concentration of growth regulators
   applied simultaneously during seeds stratification.

AB The germination of Penicillium expansum and Aspergillus niger spores was
   monitored microscopically on malt extract agar at isothermal conditions
   ranging from 0 to 33 degrees C and 5 to 41.5 degrees C, respectively.
   The obtained germination data, expressed as percentage of germination (%
   P) versus time, were fitted to the modified Gompertz equation for the
   estimation of the germination kinetic parameters (lag time, lambda(g),
   and germination rate, mu(g)), which were further modeled as a function
   of temperature via the use of Cardinal Models with Inflection (CMI). The
   effect of temperature on these parameters was similar with that
   previously reported for mycelium growth kinetics of the tested isolates.
   The germination of spores was also studied at various dynamic
   time-temperature conditions including single or sequential temperature
   shifts. The germination of spores at fluctuating temperatures was
   predicted using the modified Gompertz equation in conjunction with the
   CMI models for lambda(g) and mu(g) and based on the assumptions that i)
   a temperature shift does not result in any additional lambda(g) and,
   thus, the total lag can be calculated by adding relative parts of the
   lag time, and ii) after a temperature shift the germination rate mu(g)
   adapts instantaneously to the new temperature. The comparison between
   predicted and observed data showed that the germination of spores is
   strongly affected by the extent of the temperature shift, the percentage
   of germinated spores at the time of the shift and the fungal species.
   Apart from the scientific interest in understanding the dynamics of
   spores' germination, the models developed in this study can be used as
   tools in effective quality management systems for fungi control in
   foods. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB We describe the germination characteristics of a population of
   Zanichella palustris from the Hunter region of New South Wales,
   Australia. Laboratory experiments indicate that germination of Z.
   palustris is affected by temperature, dormancy, stratification and
   salinity. Five trials, conducted at 30-day intervals, on stored seeds
   were undertaken. The pattern of germination differed between fresh seed
   and seed-bank seeds. Higher germination occured at 20 degrees C (18-67%)
   than 28 degrees C (7-60%) and seeds within the seed-bank outperformed
   fresh seeds (49 versus 36%), in terms of total percentage and rate of
   germination. Germination was lower in freshly collected seeds and
   increased after harvest, peaking in 1- and 2-month old seeds, before
   tapering off (40, 54, 58, 35, 22%, respectively). Stratification enabled
   a higher and more regularly paced germination to occur. However, no
   significant difference was discerned between seeds stratified at 5
   degrees C for 30 days and non-stratified seeds. Although salinity did
   not appear to affect seed viability, concentrations of >= 6 ppt NaCl
   prevented germination. These germination patterns suggest that cool
   water, cold stratification and low salinity are optimal germination
   conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Premise The timing of germination has profound impacts on fitness,
   population dynamics, and species ranges. Many plants have evolved
   responses to seasonal environmental cues to time germination with
   favorable conditions; these responses interact with temporal variation
   in local climate to drive the seasonal climate niche and may reflect
   local adaptation. Here, we examined germination responses to temperature
   cues in Streptanthus tortuosus populations across an elevational
   gradient.
   Methods Using common garden experiments, we evaluated differences among
   populations in response to cold stratification (chilling) and
   germination temperature and related them to observed germination
   phenology in the field. We then explored how these responses relate to
   past climate at each site and the implications of those patterns under
   future climate change.
   Results Populations from high elevations had stronger stratification
   requirements for germination and narrower temperature ranges for
   germination without stratification. Differences in germination responses
   corresponded with elevation and variability in seasonal temperature and
   precipitation across populations. Further, they corresponded with
   germination phenology in the field; low-elevation populations germinated
   in the fall without chilling, whereas high-elevation populations
   germinated after winter chilling and snowmelt in spring and summer.
   Climate-change forecasts indicate increasing temperatures and decreasing
   snowpack, which will likely alter germination cues and timing,
   particularly for high-elevation populations.
   Conclusions The seasonal germination niche for S. tortuosus is highly
   influenced by temperature and varies across the elevational gradient.
   Climate change will likely affect germination timing, which may cascade
   to influence trait expression, fitness, and population persistence.

AB The timing of life history events, such as germination and reproduction,
   influences ecological and selective environments throughout the life
   cycle. Many organisms evolve responses to seasonal environmental cues to
   synchronize these key events with favourable conditions. Often the
   fitness consequences of each life history transition depend on previous
   and subsequent events in the life cycle. If so, shifts in environmental
   cues can create cascading effects throughout the life cycle, which can
   influence fitness, selection on life history traits, and population
   viability. We examined variation in cue responses for contingent life
   history expression and fitness in a California native wildflower,
   Streptanthus tortuosus, by manipulating seasonal germination timing in a
   common garden experiment. We also manipulated chilling exposure to test
   the role of vernalization cues for seasonal life history contingency.
   Plants germinating early in the growing season in autumn were more
   likely to flower in the first year and less likely to perennate than
   later germinants in spring. First-year reproduction and overall fitness
   was the highest for autumn cohorts. Sensitivity analyses showed that
   optimal germination date depended on survival beyond the first year and
   fruit production in later years. Experimental chilling exposure induced
   first-year flowering in spring germinants, demonstrating that seasonal
   life history contingency is mediated by a vernalization requirement.
   This requirement reduced fitness of spring germinants without increasing
   survival or later fecundity and may be maladaptive. Such mismatches
   between cues and fitness may become more pervasive as predicted climate
   change reduces exposure to chilling, shortens growing seasons, and
   increases severity of summer drought. Synthesis. Shifts in germination
   timing in seasonal environments can cause cascading effects on trait
   expression and fitness that extend beyond the first year of the life
   cycle. Climate change is likely to shift seasonal conditions,
   influencing such life history contingency, with significant impacts on
   trait expression, fitness, and population persistence. These shifts may
   cause strong natural selection on cue sensitivity and life history
   expression, but it is an open question whether populations have the
   potential for rapid adaptation in response to this selection.

AB Somatic embryogenesis is the most common regeneration system for
   grapevine (Vitis spp.). The aim of this work was the optimisation of two
   key-steps of grape somatic embryogenesis protocol: the identification of
   the best developmental stage to initiate immature anther culture and the
   improvement of somatic embryo germination. For the first topic, the
   observations of common features in three grape genotypes allowed to
   identify six flower developmental stages, in relation to the
   microsporogenesis and outward appearance of anthers and flowers. The
   best results in inducing somatic embryogenesis were obtained for V
   vinifera cultivars 'Chardonnay' and 'Barbera' when explants were
   collected at early stages of flower development and microsporogenesis,
   while in the case of the hybrid rootstock 110R somatic embryogenesis
   occurred more frequently if anthers were collected at later stages. In
   order to increase the rate of embryo conversion into plants, several
   germination treatments were tested: a) embryo chilling at 4 degrees C
   for 2, 4 and 8 weeks, b) embryo dehydration, c) addition of BAP or GA(3)
   (1 mu M) to the culture medium, d) frequent transfers of embryos on
   growth regulators-free medium, e) use of special vessels which allow
   higher gas exchange through a filter strip on the cover. These
   treatments were applied to somatic embryos of cultivars 'Grignolino' and
   [for treatments cl 'Brachetto a grappolo lungo'. Slight improvements of
   germination rate (about 10% more than the untreated control) were
   obtained with the treatments a), d) and e).

AB cf. F.A. 19 No. 1502.] Stratification at 40°F. promotes germination of
   some dormant Eucalypt seeds and increases the germination rate of seeds
   that exhibit the feature of delayed germination. The primary dormancy of
   some Eucalypt seeds is strengthened by moist storage at temperatures
   _63°. Temperature conditions unfavourable for germination of stratified
   seeds often induce a secondary dormancy in the embryos. Stratification
   widens the range of temperatures within which the seeds of some species
   will germinate. Non-stratified seeds of E. delegatensis will not
   germinate at temperatures >70°, but some seeds stratified for 4 weeks
   will germinate at 85°. Seeds of E. delegatensis and E. niphophila
   germinate at the stratification temperature of 40° after ca. 10 weeks.
   There appears to be some relationship between degree of dormancy of a

AB Objectives: This article aims to broaden the cold tolerant materials of
   cucumber. Methods: The 1818 'Changchunmici' cucumber mutants materials
   were preliminarily screened to obtain the candidate cold tolerant lines
   based on the relative germination rate and radicle growth under 13°C.
   Further, these lines were treated with 15°C/7°C in day/night 12 h/12 h
   for 10 days at seedling stage. Then chilling injury index and
   morphological indicators were investigated and some physiological index,
   electrical conductivity, MDA content and SOD activity were analyzed.
   Results: According to germination test under 13°C, mutants were divided
   into tolerant type, middle type and sensitive type. Among them, 22
   mutants were tolerant type, accounting for 1.21% of the total materials.
   Under low temperature stress, four morphological indexes of seedling
   stages indicated that selected cold tolerant mutants grew better than
   'Changchunmici' and these mutants had a lower value of chilling injury
   index, electrical conductivity, MDA content and SOD activity than
   'Changchunmici'. Based on the results, 7 cucumber lines with tolerance
   to cold stress were finally identified. Conclusions: Cold tolerant
   materials can be obtained from mutants, and these materials will be
   valuable for the research of chilling tolerance gene and future cucumber
   breeding.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A chilli cultivating method involves selecting
   field with illumination condition, deep soil, convenient irrigation and
   drainage, and free from air and water pollution as greenhouse vegetable
   production base, selecting seeds, preparing seedbed by deeply ploughing
   during 8-9 month, fertilizing 500 kg rotten farmyard manure or 200 kg
   organic fertilizer per 100 m2, improving soil structure, increasing
   organic matter content, adding 12 kg calcium phosphate and 10 kg
   potassium phosphate fertilizer on the seedbed to width of 1.2 m,
   followed by preparing nutrition soil by mixing vegetable garden soil and
   rotten farmyard manure at a ratio of 6:4 or vegetable garden soil and
   organic fertilizer at a ratio of 9:1, followed by 2 kg soil and 1 kg

   30 degrees C for 4-5 hours, rinsed and dried by wrapping with wet gauze.
   The seeds are place at 28-30 degrees C for germination, and washed with
   water for every morning and evening once. The seeds are spread under sun
   to increase germination rate and germination potential 1-2 days before
   sowing, followed by selecting sowing time in early October, watering
   with 50% phoxim to kill soil pests before planting. The 30-40 g/acre
   seeds are sown in seedbed with area of 10-15 m2, followed by covering
   seed medicine to thickness of 0.5 cm, film and shading net according to
   different germination conditions and weather, uncovering for 3-6 days,
   sprouting 45 days after planting, carrying out seedbed management and
   transplant seedlings management by maintaining temperature at 25-28
   degrees C in daytime and 18-20 degrees C in evening 1 week before

   controlled after transplant seedlings to be same as before transplant
   seedlings, carrying out fertilization, stabilizing minimum temperature
   in the greenhouse to be 5 degrees C or more in evening, paving mulch
   film on furrow several days before planting, improving ground
   temperature in mid-February-early March, performing fertilizer and water
   management by ploughing before planting, fertilizing 500-800 kg rotten
   chicken manure, 300-400 kg organic fertilizer, 50 kg potassium sulfate
   compound fertilizer, irrigation, applying mixture of 15 kg potassium
   sulfate fertilizer, 5 kg urea and foliar fertilizer with 0.3% potassium
   dihydrogen phosphate once in every 10 days for 4-5 times, performing
   water management, controlling moisture to promote rooting, increasing
   water content, maintaining soil humidity of 65-70%, temperature at 28-30
   degrees C in day and 18-20 degrees C in evening during early flowering
   field. The temperature is maintained at 25-28 degrees C in morning and
   15-18 degrees C in evening during late flowering period and early
   fruiting period. The temperature and humidity is adjusted during late
   flowering period according to weather condition, followed by controlling
   plant diseases and insect pests by using agricultural control, physical
   control, biological control and chemical control technique, and
   enforcing pesticide concentration, and harvesting after grown to normal
   thickness, color changed from light to dark color and maturity of seeds.

AB Low temperature stress during germination and early seedling growth is
   an important constraint of global production of maize. The effects of
   seed priming with 0.25%, 0.50%, and 0.75% (w/v) chitosan solutions at 15
   A degrees C on the growth and physiological changes were investigated
   using two maize (Zea mays L.) inbred lines, HuangC (chilling-tolerant)
   and Mo17 (chilling-sensitive). While seed priming with chitosan had no
   significant effect on germination percentage under low temperature
   stress, it enhanced germination index, reduced the mean germination time
   (MGT), and increased shoot height, root length, and shoot and root dry
   weights in both maize lines. The decline of malondialdehyde (MDA)
   content and relative permeability of the plasma membrane and the
   increase of the concentrations of soluble sugars and proline, peroxidase
   (POD) activity, and catalase (CAT) activity were detected both in the
   chilling-sensitive and chilling-tolerant maize seedlings after priming
   with the three concentrations of chitosan. HuangC was less sensitive to
   responding to different concentrations of chitosan. Priming with 0.50%
   chitosan for about 60 similar to 64 h seemed to have the best effects.
   Thus, it suggests that seed priming with chitosan may improve the speed
   of germination of maize seed and benefit for seedling growth under low
   temperature stress.

AB High salinity and temperature are major problems inhibiting seeds
   germination and threatening plant cover in arid environment such as the
   conditions in some regions in Tunisia. Thus, the use of adapted species
   to rehabilitate these regions could be an alternative to overcome these
   environmental constraints. In the present study, we intended to evaluate
   the effect of salt and temperature on seed germination of the wild leek
   (A. ampeloprasum L.) from two different Tunisian islands (Kneiss &
   Djerba). Three temperatures (15 degrees C, 23 degrees C & 30 degrees C)
   and four salinity levels (0, 75, 150 & 225 mM NaCl) were tested in a 14
   h dark: 10 h light photoperiod. The two studied populations showed a
   similar behaviour. The optimum temperature for seed germination was 15
   degrees C. Germination was inhibited by an increase in both temperature
   and salinity. Salt stress decreased both the final germination rate and
   the final germination percentage (PG%). Delay of germination (T-0) and
   the time to half of germination (T-50) significantly (p < 0.05)
   increased in response to salt and temperature increasing. An interaction
   between salinity and temperature completely inhibited germination in 225
   mM NaCl at 30 degrees C. Seeds transferred from salt solution to
   distilled water showed a recovery percentage (R%) varying from 0 to 40.6
   %. Viability test showed that all non-germinated seeds were alive
   proving that A. ampeloprasum adopted a strategy of temporal inhibition
   of germination to survive under salt and temperatures increasing. As
   such it could be classified as a moderately salt tolerant species.

   days of stratification (90 and 96%, respectively). PS B2 gave the best
   response (60%) after 74 days. Germination in Harrow Blood was lowest
   under all stratification periods (20-30%). As the germination percentage
   attained the maximum level, the mean germination time remained almost
   constant (14 days). A prolonged exposure to 5° reduced germination
   percentage in all lines and in PS B2 and Harrow Blood it induced
   secondary dormancy (after 103 days of chilling.).

AB Russian olive (Elaeagnus angustifolia L.), a Eurasian tree now abundant
   along rivers in western North America, has an apparent southern
   distribution limit running through southern California, Arizona, New
   Mexico and Texas. We used field observations to precisely define this
   limit in relation to temperature variables. We then investigated whether
   lack of cold temperatures south of the limit may prevent the
   accumulation of sufficient chilling, inhibiting dormancy loss of seeds
   and buds. We found that Russian olive occurrence was more strongly
   associated with low winter temperatures than with high summer
   temperatures, and results of controlled seed germination and vegetative
   bud-break experiments suggest that the chilling requirements for
   germination and bud-break are partly responsible for the southern range
   limit. Both seed germination proportion and germination time decreased
   under conditions simulating those south of the range limit. Similarly,
   percentage bud break decreased when chilling dropped below values
   typical of the range limit. In 17-65% of the years from 1980 to 2000,
   the chilling accumulated at a site near the range limit (El Paso, TX)
   would lead to a 10% or more decrease in bud-break. The potential decline
   in growth could have large fitness consequences for Russian olive. If
   climate change exhibits a warming trend, our results suggest the
   chilling requirement for bud-break of Russian olive trees will not be
   met in some years and its southern range limit may retreat northward.

   degrees C, 25 degrees C, and 10/20 degrees C) and two different light
   periods (continuous darkness and photoperiod). Germination was
   quantified as final germination percentage (FGP), mean germination time
   (MGT), and germination index (GI). Control seeds had final germination
   13.5%, mean germination time of 15.2 days, and germination index value

   determined. In this study, we investigated the effects of GA(3), the
   combination of hormone series and short-term moist chilling (1-month),
   and long-term moist chilling (4-month) on the germination percentage and
   mean germination time in relation to seed dormancy breaking. All
   treatment series were incubated under continuous dark (20 degrees C, 24
   h) and light/dark (20/10 degrees C, 12/12 h) conditions. Seeds were
   collected from specimens widespread on the alpine and subalpine
   grasslands and dwarf shrubs of Mount Uludag (1800-1900 m a.s.l.).
   Depending on the concentration, GA(3) and the combination of hormone and
   moist chilling treatments promoted seed germination in both dark and
   light/dark conditions. After 4-month-moist chilling treatment, seeds
   germinated 27% in a light/dark and 80% in a dark regime. Hormone and
   moist chilling treatments reduced the mean germination time. Our results
   showed that J. supina seeds have physiological dormancy, require
   prolonged times of moist chilling and preferentially complete
   germination in darkness.

   studied the effects of scarification, short-time moist chilling (+4
   degrees C) for 15 and 30 days, and various doses of gibberellic acid
   (GA(3); 0, 100, 150 and 250 ppm), Kinetin (KIN; 50 ppm) and a
   combination of 250 ppm GA(3) and 50 ppm KIN. The hormone and moist
   chilling treatments were carried out under both continuous darkness (20
   degrees C) and photoperiodic (20/10 degrees C; 12/12h, respectively)
   conditions. Seeds failed to germinate in response to short-time moist
   chilling treatments with distilled water under both continuous darkness
   and photoperiodic conditions. Seeds were found to have dormancy.
   Treatments with GA(3) or a combination of GA(3) and KIN were successful
   at breaking seed dormancy. A maximum of 37% of the seeds germinated
   after GA(3) application in all series. When only KIN was applied at a 50
   ppm concentration, germination (12%) was found only with moist chilling
   for 30 days under continuous darkness. The highest germination rates
   were found in seeds treated with combination of 250 ppm GA(3) and 50 ppm
   KIN. In the combination treatments, while the moist chilling treatments
   for 15 days resulted in 68 and 73% germination, respectively, these
   rates were up to 95% in the moist chilling treatments for 30 days under
   continuous darkness and photoperiodic conditions. Mean germination time
   (MGT) in GA(3) and KIN combinations was lower than in other treatments.
   Scarification with 80% sulphuric acid did not promote germination. The
   characteristics of physiological dormancy of S. germanica ssp. bithynica
   seeds are consistent with conditions of existence in the in alpine
   habitat of this species. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

   three provenances from Artvin, Turkey. Sulfuric acid was not found an
   effective scarifying agent for breaking seed coat dormancy in C.
   coggygria seeds. Germination percentage and germination rate increased
   significantly with increasing stratification duration (30 to 120 days),
   with optimum at 120 days for all seed provenances. When averaged over
   all provenances, cold stratification for 3 months resulted higher
   germination percentage (GP = 72.3%) and germination rate (PV = 8.2) than
   that of scarification. Also, germination response for different
   scarification and stratification treatments revealed a significant
   difference on germination of the provenances. Seeds scarified with
   sulfuric acid followed by cold moist stratification showed significant
   improvement for germination performance. Highest improvement observed
   under scarification (20 - 40 min) followed by stratification (30 or 60

   determination of the abscisic acid (ABA) content. The results show that
   seeds germinate to a high percentage (approximately 90%) at temperatures
   of 15 or 20 degrees C, with or without light, whereas higher
   temperatures of 25 or 30 degrees C impeded radicle protrusion and
   resulted in the germination percentage decreasing sharply (within 5%).
   Inhibition at high temperatures was thoroughly reversed (bringing about
   approximately 80% germination) by placing the ungerminated seeds in
   favorable temperatures and incubating them for an additional 30 days.
   Dry cold storage did little to reduce the temperature request for
   germination. Embryo coverings, especially the nucellar membrane, and ABA
   levels both had a dominant role in seed germination regulation in
   response to temperature. Under favorable temperature conditions, the
   levels of ABA significantly decreased. Germination occurred when the
   levels dropped to a threshold of 15 ng/g (FW (Fresh Weight)). Incubation
   at a high temperature (25 degrees C) greatly increased ABA levels and
   caused the inhibition of radicle protrusion.

AB This study was conducted to investigate the effect of chilled-water
   stratification, Gibberellic acid (GA(3)), and germination temperature on
   improving seed germination of Cimicifuga heracleifolia Komarov and
   Clematis serratifolia Rehder (Ranunculaceae), and Aster maackii Regel
   and Saussurea calcicola Nakai (Asteraceae), which are native to South
   Korea. These species are conventionally propagated by seeds, however
   improving their germination (%) will help in their preservation and
   utilization as ornamental and/or medicinal plants since their
   germination is slow and difficult. Seed pre-treatment applied before
   sowing was different durations of chilled-water stratification for
   either 0 or 40 days, followed by soaking for 24 h in a 0, 15, or 30 mg
   l(-1) GA(3) solution. Then the seeds were incubated at 15 or 25 degrees
   C, with an 80% relative humidity, in dark. Compared with 0 day of
   chilled-water treatment, the final germination percentage (FGP), days to
   25% and 50% of germination of the final germination ratio (T-25 and
   T-50), germination rate index (GRI), and mean daily germination (MDG) of
   the seeds treated for 40 days with chilled-water stratification were
   significantly increased in C. heracleifolia, C. serratifolia, and A.
   maackii. Moreover, germination was observed in both A. maackii and S.
   calcicola before the termination of 40-days of chilled-water
   stratification. The GA(3) had a significant positive effect on FGP,
   T-50, GRI, and MDG of S. calcicola, but not in C. heracleifolia, C.
   serratifolia, and A. maackii. The highest and lowest FGP were 62.0% and
   1.3% in C. heracleifolia, 10.7% and 0.0% in C. serratifolia, 46.3% and
   8.7% in A. maackii, and 69.3% and 40.0% in S. calcicola, respectively.

AB Objective: The aim was to study on the variation of endogenous hormones
   contents in Aconitum flavum Hand.-Mazz seeds during the process of
   dormancy and germination. Method: Contents of GA3, IAA, ABA and Z in new
   and old seeds of A. flavum, which was processed under stratification,
   were determined and analyzed by HPLC, respectively. The germination rate
   of seeds was investigated. Result: Content of ABA in seeds declined,
   while that of GA3 increased during the process of stratification;
   different stratification treatments had certain effects on seed
   germination with the extension of time. Conclusion: GA3 played an
   important role in breaking dormancy and promoting germination of seeds;
   ABA was an important inhibitor for germination; IAA played an important
   role in promoting seeds germination; there was no significant
   correlation between Z content and seed germination of A. flavum.

AB Attempts had been made to provide evidences insight into the pattern and
   physiological mechanism of sweet cherry fruit dropping. However, the
   fruit abscission pattern and mechanism underlying the heavy fruit
   dropping in insufficient chilling regions, especially the roles of
   interior factors including carbohydrates and hormones in abnormal fruit
   dropping, has not yet been better understood so far. Currently, four
   five-year-old sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.) cultivars, i.e., 'Santina',
   'Brooks', 'Sparkerry' and 'Black Pearl', which were grown in Weining
   County (104.28 degrees E, 26.86 degrees N), Guizhou province of China,
   were used as materials to elucidate the physiological fruit abscission
   pattern of sweet cherry and the chief interior causes for the heavy
   fruit dropping in insufficient chilling region of China. It was
   explicated that the abscission pattern of sweet cherry fruit somewhat
   varied among the cultivars in a low chilling region. Higher rate of
   pollen germination and longer polar axis length was proved to be
   remarkably beneficial to fruit development. A comparative anatomic
   dissection of fruit stalk between the retention and dropped fruit
   elaborated that there is obvious difference in the microstructure with
   the progress of fruit development. The discrepancy was mostly showed by
   the cell space of abscission zone tissues for the dropped fruit enlarged
   gradually and was remarkably larger than that of the retention ones.
   Furthermore, the imbalance of endogenous hormones in fruit is a crucial
   trigger for fruit dropping with the progress of fruit development,
   particularly the active ZR, GA, as well as IAA levels in fruit are
   positively correlated to fruit setting, conversely, ABA played a
   negative role in fruit retention. Moreover, carbohydrate contents in
   retention fruit were considerably higher than that of the dropped ones
   during the fruit development, however, the contents of glucose and
   fructose in dropped fruit did not reach the required threshold which was
   possibly a vital cause leading to fruit abscission.

AB Seeds planted in early spring frequently experience low temperature
   stress in the soil during germination and early plant growth. Seed
   pretreatments such as priming have been shown to ameliorate the negative
   effects of cold soil in some crops. However, the potential beneficial
   effects of priming have not been widely investigated for Zea mays
   (maize). To investigate seed priming effects, 24 diverse maize inbred
   lines were primed using a synthetic solid matrix, Micro-Cel E, and then
   exposed to 10 degrees C soil conditions. Six DSLR cameras captured time
   lapsed images of emerging seedlings. Manual scoring was used to
   determine treatment effects on three seedling emergence metrics.
   Chilling substantially reduced total emergence for two of 24 genotypes
   evaluated. For these genotypes, priming provided protection allowing
   nearly full emergence. Priming significantly reduced mean emergence time
   and increased the emergence uniformity of chilling sensitive genotypes.
   The results suggest that the cold sensitive genotypes may benefit from
   priming pretreatment. Kernel density, weight, oil, protein, and starch
   traits, as determined by single-kernel near infrared spectroscopy, were
   not correlated with seedling emergence traits supporting a conclusion
   that early seedling performance cannot be determined from these maize
   kernel characteristics.

   important species namely Rheum australe D. Don (syn. Rheum emodi Wall.
   ex Meissn.)/rhubarb and Podophyllum hexandrum Royle for their effective
   conservation. The propagation of these species through seeds takes lot
   of time, due to dormancy and poor germination rate. Germination of seeds
   in R. australe was monitored up to 25th day of the treatment. The best
   results were recorded in 50 days chilled seeds with 92% germination;;
   followed by 86 and 82 percent germinations in 40 and 30 day chilled
   seeds, respectively. Treatment CHl3 (50 day chilled seeds) was
   statistically different from all other treatments including chilling
   treatments chl1 (30 day chilled seeds) and chl2 (40 day chilled seeds).
   Treatments GA31 (Gibbrellic acid 10-3 M) and GA32 (Gibbrellic acid 10-4
   M) with 80% and 75% germination respectively, were at par with each
   other. Coefficient of variation for all the treatments was 43%,
   indicating that the treatments were variable with respect to each other.
   Across days, highest mean (standard deviation) (60.4526.38) and range
   (0-92) was observed on 14th day. In P. hexandrum germination started on
   27th day and was completed by 90th day. Maximum germination percentage
   of (66%) was observed in treatment Comb1 (H2SO4 treatment for 8 minutes,
   GA31=10-3 M) and the least (8%) in treatment S2 (H2SO4 treatment for 8
   minutes). No germination was observed in all the three chilling
   treatments (Ch1; Ch2; Ch3) as well as in potassium nitrate (K1=0.2%:
   K2=0.3%) and control treatments. All the treatments were varied
   statistically from each other. The coefficient of variation and mean

   Priming did not significantly affect subsequent water uptake prior to
   visible germination in tabasco, or in jalapeno seeds primed for 1 to 4
   days. Priming tabasco seeds significantly increased both the rate and
   percentage of germination. Tabasco seedling hypocotyl development was
   not significantly increased by priming, and was reduced in some
   treatments. Priming jalapeno seeds did not significantly increase
   germination percentage, but did increase germination rate and hypocotyl
   development. Priming tabasco seeds for 3 to 8 days generally reduced O2
   uptake relative to the water-soak control for 16 h after removal from
   priming solution. At 40 h following priming, respiration rates of primed
   seeds were significantly greater than the control, and at 44 h
   germination was observed in all primed treatments. Oxygen uptake in
   jalapeno seeds primed 2 to 4 days was significantly increased relative
   to the control at all times after removal from the priming solution.
   Seed respiration was not correlated with pre-germination water content.
   Tabasco seed respiration at time of germination was correlated (p =
   0.05) with rate of germination (r = -0.78) and percentage germination (r
   = 0.73). Jalapeno seed respiration rate was correlated (p = 0.05) with
   length of priming treatment (r = 0.93) and rate of germination (r =

AB Seed germination is an important developmental and life history stage.  
   Yet, the evolutionary impact of germination has mainly been studied in
   the      context of dormancy, or for its role in reproductive isolation
   between      species. Here, we aim to examine multiple consequences of
   genetic      divergence on germination traits between two Arabidopsis
   lyrata      subspecies: ssp. petraea (Eurasia) and ssp. lyrata
   (North-America).      Post-dormancy germination time, a potentially
   adaptive trait, showed      differentiation between the populations, and
   quantitative trait loci (QTL)      mapping revealed that the trait
   variation is mainly controlled by two      antagonistic loci. These QTL
   areas contain several candidate genes with      known function in
   post-dormancy germination in A. thaliana. The sequence      variation of
   three genes was consistent with differential selection, and      they
   also included fixed nonsynonymous substitutions with potential to     
   account for the phenotypic differentiation. We further show that the    
   divergence between the subspecies has led to a slight but significant   
   reduction in hybrid germination proportions, indicating incipient     
   reproductive isolation. Comparison of reciprocal F1 and F2 progenies    
   suggest that Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller-incompatibilities likely act     
   through uniparentally inherited factors. Examination of genome-wide     
   transmission ratio distortion further revealed that cytonuclear     
   interactions cause substantial pregermination inviability in the
   hybrids.      These results confirm that seed germination has adaptive
   potential beyond      the dormancy stage and that hybrid seed
   inviability can be one of the      first reproductive barriers to arise
   during divergence. Measurements of seed germination in Arabidopsis

AB Magnolia ingrata is an endangered species in China. Freshly matured
   seeds of M. ingrata had an underdeveloped embryo, which grew during cold
   stratification at 4 degrees C. Both cold stratification and GA(3)
   overcame dormancy of M. Ingrata seeds. Thus. M. ingrata seeds have
   intermediate complex morphophysioloeical dormancy at maturity. Since
   seeds came out of dormancy after after-ripening for 100 d at 4 degrees
   C. the physiological component of morphophysiological dormancy is
   non-deep. The initial moisture content of M. ingrata seeds was 29.5%.
   Most seeds (86.1 %) tolerated desiccation to 17.2% moisture content
   while more than 70% of seeds lost viability when dried to 15.3% moisture
   content. Therefore, storage behaviour of M. ingrata seed is
   recalcitrant. All seeds died after storage for 100 d at -20 degrees C
   while seed viability was effectively maintained at 4 degrees C.

AB Low germination rate is a key factor influencing seed germination of the
   European Mountain-Ash (Sorbus aucuparia). This study focused on the
   effects of the treatments of stratification and gibberellin soaking on
   the seed germination rate of 5 different Sorbus aucuparia provenances
   from different altitudes of European Alps. Compared with the
   stratification under a varying temperature within the range of 5-6°C (at
   an average of 5.6°C), the time for beginning germination after the
   stratification with a two-stage temperature treatment (firstly 2.9°C for
   60 days and then 5°C till sowing) was postponed by 0-24 days, indicating
   the temperature of the stratification affects the germination speed.
   However, the germination rate after the two-stage temperature
   stratification was obviously higher than those after the stratification
   with a varying temperature in range of 5-6°C. For example, the
   germination rate for the provenances of No. 2, 3 and 6 was increased
   from less than 1% to 15%, 57.8% and 14% respectively. However, there was
   no difference in germination rate between the 2 stratification
   treatments for the provenances of No. 4 and 5, indicating different
   characters among provenances. A treatment of a 6-8 h soaking in
   gibberellin solution was helpful to break the seed dormancy and increase
   the germination rate obviously. The germination rate after the soaking

AB Objective: In recent years, extreme weather such as low temperature
   chilling injury occurred frequently during the sowing and emergence of
   maize in the northern spring maize region, resulting in slow emergence
   and poor uniformity of seeds, which ultimately affected the quality and
   yield of maize. In this study, maize germplasm from the United States,
   Germany, former Yugoslavia, Canada and China were selected for the
   identification of low temperature germination resistance, and the
   germplasm with strong low temperature germination resistance was
   selected to provide material basis and technical support for the
   improvement of low temperature resistant germplasm and the breeding of
   new varieties. Methods: 74 maize inbred lines were taken as materials,
   the field survey direct method and indoor assay method were applied,
   through the investigation, to determine the 10 indexes such as the
   standard germination rate (SGR), cold immerse germination rate (CIGR),
   normal field emergence potential (NFEP), normal field emergence rate
   (NFER), low field emergence potential (LFEP), low field emergence rate
   (LFER), normal Field germination index (NFGI), normal field vigor index
   (NFVI), low field germination index (LFGI) and low field vigor index
   (LFVI). The ability of maize seeds to germinate under low temperature
   was evaluated by the method of membership function and multivariate
   statistical analysis. And also, the ability of maize seeds to resist low
   temperature germination was evaluated by using membership function and
   multivariate statistical analysis. Results: There were abundant genetic
   variations in the low temperature germination tolerance of maize inbred
   lines tested.10 appraisal index of genetic variation coefficient were
   between 10.10%-145.47%, and the cumulative contribution rate was
   73.554%, maize inbred lines was established by stepwise regression seed
   germination ability at low temperature resistance comprehensive
   evaluation mathematics model of low temperature resistant
   YLTR=0.162+0.250 XNFGI+0.246 XLFGI. The predicted results with the
   method of subordinate function value (L) the evaluation results are
   basically identical. Finally, 74 inbred lines were divided into 5 grades
   based on the comprehensive evaluation value of low-temperature
   germination tolerance: one inbred line with very strong low-temperature
   germination tolerance, 12 inbred lines with rather strong
   low-temperature germination resistance, 45 inbred lines with moderate
   low-temperature germination resistance,13 inbred lines with weak
   low-temperature germination resistance and 3 inbred lines with extremely
   weak low-temperature germination resistance. Conclusion: The selected
   inbred lines Shen137, D3M and JSH2402 with very weak germination
   resistance at low temperature and Xinzi3113 with strong germination
   resistance at low temperature will be applied in the research of
   low-temperature QTL mapping, germplasm innovation and new variety
   selection. Field germination index at room temperature and field
   germination index at low temperature can be used as main indexes to
   evaluate the low temperature tolerance of inbred lines.

AB A regeneration protocol via direct somatic embryogenesis from the
   plumules of in vitro-sown seedlings was developed in hot pepper
   (Capsicum annuum L.). To induce somatic embryogenesis of hot pepper, the
   effects of various culture conditions and genotypes were evaluated.
   After mature seeds were directly sown on a modified Murashige and
   Skoog's medium for pepper (MMSP) supplemented with
   2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 6-benzylaminopurine (BA), and
   high sucrose, the germination rate, formation of callus, and somatic
   embryogenesis were checked. The germinated seedlings of selected MC-12
   and CCA323 among tested genotypes were transferred to plant growth
   regulator (PGR)-free MMSP, and then the frequency of somatic
   embryogenesis was investigated. The somatic embryogenesis from plumules
   of hot pepper seedlings was affected by cytokinins in particular
   genotypes: the frequency of somatic embryogenesis was decreased on the
   sowing media with more than 1 mg.L-1 BA and the transplanting medium
   with zeatin. Meanwhile, the partial substitution with D-mannitol for
   high sucrose did not influence the somatic embyrogeneis. Collectively,
   the highest rate (38.3%) of somatic embryo induction from plumule was
   obtained when the seeds of 'MC-12' inbred line were sown on the MMSP
   with 2 mg.L-1 2,4-D, 1 mg.L-1 BA, and 80 g.L-1 sucrose at 25°C with
   illumination for 16 hours each day, and then transferred into the MMSP
   with no PGR and 30 g.L-1 sucrose. Isolated somatic embryos germinated
   into normal plantlets after sub-culturing to PGR-free MMSP. The
   regenerants were easily acclimatized in a greenhouse and grew into
   mature plants. Most of the somatic embryo-derived plants were
   undistinguishable from the wild-type ones by their phenotypes except for
   only one somaclonal variant. In addition, all of the somatic
   embryo-derived mature plants normally set the fruits and generated the
   next progenies. We believe that the present results might be helpful for
   incorporating into a genetic engineering system in hot pepper.

AB To obtain the convenient indices for identifying the chilling tolerance
   of tomato rootstocks and to screen out tomato rootstocks with strong
   chilling tolerance, we examined the effects of different temperatures
   (28, 20, 15 degrees C ) on the seed germination and the changes of
   seedling's chilling injury of 40 tomato rootstocks under low temperature
   stress (10 degrees C/3 degrees C ), and analyzed the correlation between
   seedling chilling injury index and seed germination indices. There was
   no significant difference in germination rate, germination index and
   vigor index among the different rootstock's seeds at 28 degrees C , but
   the germination related indices at 15 and 20 degrees C significantly
   differed with those at 28 degrees C. There were significant differences
   in the chilling index among the seedlings of different rootstocks under
   the low temperature of 10 degrees C/3 degrees C (day/night). The
   chilling index of the seedlings was significantly correlated with the
   germination indexes under the low temperature, with the correlation
   coefficient at 20 degrees C being higher than that at 15 degrees C. The
   regression model of seedling ' s chilling injury index was established
   by multiple stepwise regres-sion analysis. The relative germination rate
   and relative germination index at 20 degrees C were selected, and the
   determination coefficient of the model was 0.984 (P<0.001). According to
   the results of clustering analysis, the rootstocks could be divided into
   cold-tolerant, cold-sensitive, and intermediate types. There were six
   cold-tolerant materials and five cold-sensitive materials. The cluster
   analysis by using the two factors selected by the chilling index
   regression model found that the classification of 39 out of 40 materials
   was the same as that from the cluster analysis of seedling's chilling
   injury index, except that one material was classifies into the
   cold-sensitive type rater than into the intermediate type. In all, our
   results showed that the relative germination rate and relative
   germination index of the seeds at 20 degrees C could be used as
   convenient indices for identifying tomato chilling tolerance at seedling
   stage.

AB Objective: This study was carried out to investigate the natural
   regeneration and the way of promoting seed germination in Cancrinia
   discoidea. Method: Community of Cancrinia discoidea field survey was
   done by plot method. The experiment set 5 different temperatures 2/5°C,
   5/15°C, 10/20°C, 15/5°C, 15/30°C (12 h light/12 h dark), seed soaking
   with NaOH and GA3, and low temperature stratification treatment to
   measure the seed germination rate and germination index. Result: The
   average density reached 90.16 plants/m2. The highest germination rate
   was 46% and germination index 3.45 of seed was recorded at 15/30°C. Low
   temperature could inhibit seed germination. Seed did not germinate at
   2/5°C. By NaOH soaking and low temperature stratification treatment, the
   seed germination rate and germination index dropped. By soaking with 750
   mg/L concentration of GA3 acid, germination rate and germination index
   reached 78% and 8. Conclusion: Seed propagation was the only way to
   natural regeneration of C. discoidea. In nature, rich seed resources
   could protect the population of good continuation. Low seed germination
   in the laboratory test indicated there was apparent dormancy in the seed
   of C. discoidea. Temperature was an important factor for the seed
   germination. There was a positive correlation between seed germination
   rate and temperature. Seed germinated better in higher temperature than
   that in lower one. The results revealed that the seed coat permeability
   of C. discoidea was well, and it could not inhibit seed germination. The
   main causes might be some inhibitory substances in the seed. Hormone
   treatment could be an effective means to improve the seed germination of
   C. discoidea in the future production.

AB The optimal conditions of seeds germination for different cultivars was
   studied. The results showed that the suitable germination temperature
   varied with different cultivars. The optimal germination temperature was
   20 degrees C for early flowering cultivars 'Raizan No. 1', while for
   medium flowering cultivar 'Rinzan No. 2' and late flowering cultivar
   'Raizan No. 3', the suitable temperature were 18 degrees C and 15
   degrees C separately. During the process of seed germination, lighting
   time and light constitutes didn't have significant effect on germination
   rate. The experiments showed that the germination rates of three
   cultivars decreased greatly when germination temperature was over 24
   degrees C, especially for 'Raizan No. 1'. So, different pre-chilling
   treatments of 'Raizan No. 1' were taken, in order to solve this problem.
   The results indicated that germination at 30 degrees C was accelerated
   by pre-chilling treatment at 10 degrees C for more than 10 days,
   germination rate was more than 75%,and it was 85.22% by the same
   pretreatment for 20 days, the same as optimal germination temperature 20
   degrees C. Whereas pretreatment at 3 or 5 degrees C had no promotive
   effects at 30 degrees C germination condition, germination rate was less
   than 40%. In conclusion, pre-chiding treatmet at 10 degrees C for more
   than 10 days was recommended to germination of Lilium x formolongi under
   high temperature conditions.

AB Expansins are cell wall proteins inducing cell wall loosening and
   participate in all plant growth and development processes which are
   associated with cell wall modifications. Here, TaEXPB23, a wheat
   expansin gene, was investigated and the tolerance to oxidative stress
   was strongly enhanced in over-expression tobacco plants. Our results
   revealed that over-expressing TaEXPB23 influenced the activity of
   antioxidant enzymes: in particular, the activity of the cell wall-bound
   peroxidase. The enhanced tolerance to oxidative stress and increased
   cell wall-bound peroxidase activity were partly inhibited by an
   anti-expansin antibody. The Arabidopsis expansin mutant atexpb2 showed
   reduced cell wall-bound peroxidase activity and decreased oxidative
   stress tolerance. In addition, atexpb2 exhibited lower chlorophyll
   contents and the germination rate compared to wild type (WT). Taken
   together, these results provided a new insight on the role of expansin
   proteins in plant stress tolerance by cell wall bound peroxidase. (C)

   Melatonin treatments on germination of radish and spinach seeds under
   different temperature conditions. Treated with different concentrations
   of L-Tryptophan (125, 250, 375 ppm) and Melatonin (5, 10, 25 M) seeds
   were subjected to germination tests at optimum (21 ??C) chilling stress
   (7 ??C) and high temperature (35 ??C) conditions. Treated with distilled
   water seeds were considered as control. The tested hormones had
   significant effects on the average germination time; the time to reach
   50% germination rate; and the fresh weight results of the radish seeds
   at low temperature (7 ??C) condition. At this temperature, the treatment
   of 10 M melatonin prolonged the mean germination time and the time to
   reach 50% germination rate of the seeds compared to the hormone
   untreated seeds. 125 ppm and 250 ppm L-Tryptophan treatments increased
   the fresh weight values. The greatest effect of the hormone treatment in
   spinach seeds was observed in the time to reach 50% germination rate at
   low temperature condition (7 ??C). The 375 ppm dose of L-Tryptophan
   shortened this it as compared to the control, while 25 M melatonin
   treatments prolonged this period.

AB 1 Najas marina is a summer annual of shallow lakes that reaches its
   distributional limit in the Norfolk Broads of eastern England. Seeds are
   shed in autumn and overwinter in lake sediments.
   2 We investigated the influence of growing-season length on seed
   maturity and germinability and the cumulative effects of winter
   temperatures on patterns of germinability. Seeds were stratified for up
   to 1 year and tested for germinability at 4-week intervals. Data-loggers
   recorded temperatures simultaneously at the field site and in the cold
   room. Cumulative temperature below a threshold (thermal time) was used
   to relate behaviour in cold storage to phenology.
   3 Most seeds were dormant at collection. Cold storage of imbibed seed
   resulted in loss of dormancy. The proportion of non-dormant seeds peaked
   after a cold treatment equivalent to one winter, i.e. coinciding with
   favourable temperatures for germination in the field. Continued cold
   stratification resulted in a cycle of secondary dormancy and its
   subsequent relief; the thermal time characterizing the second, lower,
   peak in germinability coincided approximately with that attained in the
   field in the second spring after collection.
   4 Shortening the growing season of Najas marina, by collecting material
   before natural senescence was complete, reduced the proportion of mature
   seeds, lowered average germinability and increased germination times.
   5 The thermal capacity of water bodies causes a lag in spring warming,
   whereas declining light becomes limiting in autumn. Najas marina is
   crucially dependent on the length of growing season to produce
   sufficient viable seed. A low-temperature requirement to break seed
   dormancy prevents inappropriate autumn germination. In a prolonged
   winter (necessarily followed by a shorter growing season), a significant
   proportion of seed would go into secondary dormancy and remain in the
   seed bank until the second spring.
   6 In annual plants, such requirements for warm summers and cold winters
   could contribute to a continental-climate distribution in northern
   Europe. In the case of Najas marina this might explain its limit at the
   eastern extremity of England and thus its rarity.

   importance of varietal differences in achene germination, with
   significant differences being shown between the hybrids Redcoat *
   Bogota, Redcoat * Sivetta, Red Gauntlet * Ostara, 7705/15 * Orlanda,
   Belrubi * Savio and Cardinal * Bogota. The other 2 trials conducted with
   the cv. Tenira and with Ostara and Tribute, showed that there was no
   marked difference in the germination rate of achenes from primary and
   secondary fruits. Obtaining achenes up to 10 days before fruit maturity
   appeared practicable, though there was some reduction in germination as
   a result. Measures tested which improved germination were: exposure of
   the achenes to a solution of 2000 p.p.m. ethephon for 24 h before
   sowing, cold stratification for 6 weeks at 4°C before sowing (although
   this would result in a consequent delay in a breeding programme) and
   exposure to light during the period between sowing and emergence (i.e.
   not covering the achenes with sand).

AB An experiment was conducted to study the seed coat permeability, embryo
   morphological post-maturation and germination inhibitory substance in
   Prunus maackii seeds. The dormancy mechanism of P. maackii seeds was
   discussed. Results show that the water permeability of seed coat of P.
   maackii is low. Water absorption rates were 32.97% and 27.79% for
   scarified seeds and non-scarified seeds respectively (P<0.05). An
   obvious phenomenon of embryo morphological post-maturation of P. maackii
   was observed. The proportion of the length of embryo to the length of
   endosperm was 35.08% for the seeds after stratification treatment, which
   was significantly different from that of the control (P<0.05).
   Germination inhibitory substance was found in P. maackii seeds. The
   activity of germination inhibitory substance declined with the prolonged
   stratification time. Cabbages were treated with the extraction liquid
   from P. maackii seeds after the combination of warm and cold
   stratification. Seed germination percentage of the cabbages increased
   from 18.7% to 56.0%. The inhibition effect of the extraction liquid from
   P. maackii seeds on the growth of seedling height and root length
   decreased with the prolonged stratification time. The optimal
   combination for the seed germination of P. maackii was to soak the seeds
   with 500 mg.L-1 GA3 for 48 h by a 90-day warm stratification followed by
   130-day cold stratification, and the seeds showed an average germination
   rate of 43.8%. P. maackii seeds belong to combinational dormancy.
   Treating the seeds with GA3 combined with stratification could
   effectively break the seed dormancy in P. maackii.

AB Seed germination is the first and most sensitive developmental stage in
   the plant life cycle and the key process in seedling emergence. On the
   other hand, one of the major barriers to optimum use of medicinal plants
   outside the natural habitat is limited level of seed germination and
   seed dormancy. Hence in order to find the best priming and temperature
   treatment to dormancy breaking and seed germination of medicinal plant
   seed Pulicaria gnaphalodes (Vent.) Boiss a factorial experiment based on
   the completely randomized design with four replications and two factors
   was conducted in Islamic Azad University, Birjand branch in 2017. The
   first factor of priming type is 11 levels included in potassium nitrate
   2% treatment at two times of 24 and 48 hours, gibberellic acid (0, 250
   and 500 mg/l) at two times of 24 and 48 hours, and stratification (7, 14
   and 21 days). The second factor was temperature at three levels (15, 20
   and 25°c). The results showed that highest germination rate and percent
   germination were related to stratification at 7 and 21 days at 25°c and
   maximum seedling length, plumule length, radicle length, radicle/plumule
   length ratio, wet weight of seedling, dry weight of seedling, percent
   germination, germination rate, longitudinal index seed vigor, weight
   index seed vigor related to 21 days wet temperature and 15°c. Therefore,
   21 days stratification and temperatures of 15 and 25°c were the best
   priming and temperature treatments to dormancy breaking and seed
   germination of medicinal plant seed Pulicaria gnaphalodes.

AB Scotch broom is a large, leguminous shrub that has invaded 27 U.S.
   states. The species produces seeds with a hard coat that remain viable
   in the soil for years. Growth-chamber Studies were conducted to
   determine effects of temperature regime and cold-stratification period
   on seed germination. Seedling emergence, mortality, and biomass also
   were studied in response to sulfometuron and metsulfuron herbicides and
   variation in soil texture and watering regime. Germination was greatest
   for a dark/light temperature regime of 15/20 C. Initial rates of
   germination increased as stratification period was varied from 0 to 60
   d, but final germination after 90 d did not differ significantly among
   periods. Applied alone or in combination, sulfometuron and metsulfuron
   decreased biomass and increased mortality of seedlings. Mortality from
   simulated soil drought was greater in the presence versus absence of
   sulfometuron (20 and 6% mortality, respectively) probably because the
   herbicide reduced root biomass by 58 to 95%. Invasiveness of Scotch
   broom is facilitated by a prolonged period of germination across a broad
   temperature range. Increased control of Scotch broom seedlings with
   sulfometuron is likely if application is timed to expose recently
   emerged seedlings to developing conditions of soil drought.

AB Eucalyptus ovata is a medium size tree which grows from near sea level
   to sub-alpine regions in the south-east of Australia and is increasingly
   being used for woodland restoration in Tasmania. Given the wide
   attitudinal range of the species, we investigated whether a wet, cold
   stratification treatment enhanced seed germination of high altitude
   provenances. Open-pollinated seeds were harvested from five trees from a
   high and low altitude provenance within each of the five geographic
   regions from across E. ovata's distribution in Tasmania Chilling imbibed
   seeds at 5 degrees C for three weeks had no effect on the overall
   proportion of viable seeds which germinated. There were, however,
   significant provenance differences in seed weight and the germination
   traits (i.e. proportion of viable seeds, germination rate and overall
   proportion germinated) which were variably linked to differences in
   altitude. Seed viability tended to increase with seed mass and
   provenance-level correlations amongst germination traits suggested that
   seeds from different provenances differed in germination vigour. These
   results indicate that provenance rather than a pre-treatment determines
   germination success of E. ovata seed, but these provenance differences
   are not predictable and that selection of heavier seeds may increase
   germination success in the nursery and in direct seeding applications.

AB In the last few decades there has been a significant decrease of
   biodiversity in Europe. To counter this trend, harvested-seed mixtures
   from potential donor sites can be used to establish semi-natural
   grassland. It is important to guarantee a certain level of seed quality
   and successful germination as well as the regional provenance of the
   harvested seed mixtures. In this study, seed material was harvested via
   on-site threshing from an Arrhenatherion meadow, stored under room
   temperature, and 400 randomly selected seeds of harvested mixtures were
   tested in two germination trials in a climate chamber for four weeks. In
   the first trial, three substrates (potting soil, sand and filter paper)
   were tested. Germinated seedlings were counted as monocots and dicots.
   Potting soil showed the highest germination rate. In the second trial,
   the germination capacity of the seed mixture was tested on potting soil
   with and without pre-chilling after addition of potassium nitrate
   (KNO3), addition of gibberellin acid (GA3), and without addition of
   chemicals. In general, the germination capacity of the pre-chilled
   variants was lower. Variants with KNO3 developed a higher rate of
   monocots, and variants with GA3 showed a slight increase in
   dicotyledonous seedlings. The germination capacity of treated variants
   was lower than the variant without pre-chilling or chemical treatment.

AB In the frame of the sustainable use of neglected and underutilized
   phytogenetic resources, and along with numerous studies in Abies spp.
   due to the innate conservation value of fir forests, this research
   focused on the Moroccan endemic fir, Abies marocana. The aim was
   triple-fold: to assess its potential and dynamics in economic sectors
   for sustainable exploitation; to determine the ecological conditions in
   which the species naturally thrives; and to find the appropriate
   requirements for its successful seed germination. We sourced
   multifaceted evaluations for three economic sectors performed in three
   levels, using 48 attributes and eight criteria from previous studies of
   our own, and the relevant species-specific assessments are overviewed
   herein in detail. The species' ecological profile was constructed using
   Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and open access data (Worldclim).
   Seed germination trials were performed to examine the effect of cold
   stratification (non-stratified, one- and two-months stratified seeds),
   the influence of four temperatures (10 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 20
   degrees C, and 25 degrees C), and interactions thereof in relation to
   germination percentage (GP) and mean germination time (MGT). The
   experiments showed that the interaction of cold stratification and
   germination temperature has a strong effect on the GP and MGT of A.
   marocana seeds. A detailed GIS-derived ecological profile of the focal
   species was created in terms of precipitation and temperature natural
   regimes, enabling the interpretation of the seed germination results.
   The multifaceted evaluations reveal an interesting potential of the
   Moroccan fir in different economic sectors, which is mainly compromised
   due to extant research gaps, unfavorable conditions, and low stakeholder
   attraction. The findings of this study fill in extant research gaps,
   contribute to in situ and ex situ conservation strategies, and can
   facilitate the sustainable exploitation of this emblematic local endemic
   plant of northern Morocco.

   seedlots each of interior spruce (Picea glauca x engelmannii complex),
   lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.), Douglas-fir
   (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) and western red cedar (Thuja
   plicata Donn ex D. Donn). Effects of eight seed treatments on
   post-freezing survival of seeds and germinants were tested: dry, imbibed
   and stratified seed, and seed placed in a growth chamber for 2, 5, 10,
   15, 20 or 30 days in a 16-h photoperiod and a 22/17 degreesC
   thermoperiod. Survival was related to the water content of seeds and
   germinants, germination rate and seedlot origin.
   After freezing for 3 h at -196 degreesC, dry seed of most seedlots of
   interior spruce, Douglas-fir and western red cedar had 84-96%
   germination, whereas lodgepole pine seedlots had 53-82% germination.
   Freezing tolerance declined significantly after imbibition in lodgepole
   pine, Douglas-fir and interior spruce seed (western red cedar was not
   tested), and mean LT50 of imbibed seed of these species was -30, -24.5
   and -20 degreesC, respectively. Freezing tolerance continued to decline
   to a minimum LT50 of -4 to -7 degreesC after 10 days in a growth chamber
   for interior spruce, Douglas-fir and lodgepole pine, or after 15 days
   for western red cedar. Minimum freezing tolerance was reached at the
   stage of rapid hypocotyl elongation. In all species, a slight increase
   in freezing tolerance of germinants was observed once cotyledons emerged
   from the seed coat. The decrease in freezing tolerance during the
   transition from dry to germinating seed correlated with increases in
   seed water content. Changes in freezing tolerance between 10 and 30 days
   in the growth chamber were not correlated with seedling water content.
   Within a species, seedlots differed significantly in freezing tolerance
   after 2 or 5 days in the growth chamber. Because all seedlots of
   interior spruce and lodgepole pine germinated quickly, there was no
   correlation between seedlot hardiness and rate of germination.
   Germination rate and freezing tolerance of Douglas-fir and western red
   cedar seedlots was negatively correlated. There was a significant
   correlation between LT50 after 10 days in the growth chamber and minimum
   spring temperature at the location of seedlot origin for interior spruce
   and three seedlots of western red cedar, but no relationship was
   apparent for lodgepole pine and Douglas-fir.

AB Dormancy break and germination requirements for Quercus pagoda (Raf.)
   acorns were determined, as well as the effects of acorn pretreatment and
   post-germination temperatures on epicotyl emergence, seedling
   development, and seedling biomass accumulation. There was an inverse
   linear relationship between length of cold stratification (5/1 degrees C
   for 0-12weeks) and cumulative germination percentages in all incubation
   temperatures (15/6, 20/10, 25/15, 30/20 degrees C). Acorns required
   12weeks of cold stratification to break dormancy. Gibberellic acid
   substituted for cold stratification; although, it was not as effective
   as 12weeks cold stratification. At 16weeks of cold stratification, 20%
   of acorns had germinated, and the remaining 80% of ungerminated acorns
   reached 97 +/- 1% cumulative germination within 4days in all incubation
   temperatures. Post-germination time to epicotyl emergence and to leaf
   flush was a function of temperature, and time decreased with increased
   temperatures. With light held constant (50molm(-2)s(-1)), seedlings
   accumulated greater biomass in temperatures >20/10 degrees C. Q. pagoda
   acorns possess Type 2 nondeep physiological dormancy, and this allows
   for artificial manipulation of timing and duration of germination.
   Extending cold stratification 4weeks beyond dormancy break (i.e.,
   16weeks) yields more uniform germination across a range of temperatures.
   Epicotyl emergence, seedling development, and biomass accumulation may
   be regulated by manipulating growing temperature. In this study, the
   most uniform seedling cohort with the greatest total biomass was
   produced when acorns received 16weeks of cold stratification, followed
   by transfer of germinants to 30/20 degrees C.

AB Spartina alterniflora, intentionally or unintentionally introduced
   worldwide, has adversely impacted local Japanese ecosystems. Thus,
   prediction of future distributions of S. alterniflora and its management
   are required. Local population expansion after establishment depends
   heavily on asexual (clonal) reproduction, whereas sexual (seed)
   reproduction is one of the critical factors for estimating invasion
   success and the likelihood of colonization to new habitats. However,
   knowledge about the germination characteristics of S. alterniflora is
   lacking. Here, we report the environmental conditions suitable for
   germination of S. alterniflora, under variable conditions of cold
   stratification periods (0, 4, 8 weeks), temperature (constant,
   alternating temperature), light (light/dark, dark), and oxygen (aerobic,
   anaerobic). Cumulative germination rate of S. alterniflora increased
   with an increasing period of cold stratification. Its seeds clearly
   preferred aerobic conditions to germinate. Also, the germination rate
   was higher under alternating temperature than under constant temperature
   regardless of light and oxygen conditions in any cold stratification
   period. However, long-term cold stratification, alternating temperature,
   and aerobic conditions were more important for germination of S.
   alterniflora than light. Removal of soil seed banks within 8 weeks of
   cold stratification after seed dispersals with matured seeds may be
   effective approaches for disrupting the germination of S. alterniflora.

AB The timing of germination is a crucial event in a plant's life cycle.
   Seed dormancy and germination mechanisms are important factors
   regulating seedling emergence. Since detailed experimental evidence of
   the germination pattern of Phoenix canariensis Chabaud colonizing
   sub-tropical climates is scarce, we investigated seed dormancy and
   germination ecology of P. canariensis. We found that the embryo is
   underdeveloped at the time of dispersal and doubles in size before the
   cotyledonary petiole (CP) protrudes through the operculum. The primary
   root and plumule emerge from the elongated CP outside the seed. In
   light/dark cycles of 30/25 degrees C, the CP emerged from 8% of the
   diaspores within 30 days and from 76% within 14 weeks. Thus, 8% of the
   diaspores have morphological dormancy and the others have
   morphophysiological dormancy. Removal of the pericarp and operculum
   resulted in 100% germination within five days in a light/dark cycle of
   30/25 degrees C. Cold and warm stratification as well as treatment with
   GA(3) significantly increased the germination speed but the final
   germination percentage was not significantly increased. Seed germination
   was synchronized in early summer when seed dormancy was released by cold
   stratification in the soil over winter. A remote-tubular germination
   type and intricate root system provide an ecological advantage to
   seedling establishment.

AB Drought is an important environmental constraint limiting the
   productivity of many crops worldwide. Seedling tolerance to drought is
   crucial for crop growth and development through the whole season under
   water-limited condition. Experiments were conducted to investigate the
   effects of seed pretreatment by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) on drought
   tolerance in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seedlings. H2O2-pretreated
   seeds exhibited 56% higher in germination rate than the water-pretreated
   seeds (control) under PGE-induced drought condition. Level of H2O2 in
   seedlings arising from H2O2-treated seeds grown under drought stress was
   markedly lower than the controls, indicating the operation of
   antioxidant system in them. These seedlings exhibited increased growth
   characteristics including higher net photosynthetic rate, leaf area and
   dry weight. Moreover, H2O2 treatment improved water use efficiency (WUE)
   and proline level. H2O2 pretreatment enhanced the membrane stability, as
   revealed from greatly reduced membrane damage rate (MDA) and
   malondialdehyde (MDA) content. The seedlings showed the higher
   expression of antioxidative enzyme such as catalase (CAT) and ascorbate
   peroxidase (APX). The present data suggest that H2O2, a stress signal,
   could trigger the activation of antioxidants in seeds, which persists in
   the seedlings to alleviate the oxidative damage, leading to improvements

   (4-30 degrees C) and hormone (GA(3)) treatments on the seed germination
   and seedling establishment of Suaeda aralocaspica (Chenopodiaceae), an
   annual halophyte only distributed in Xinjiang of Northwest China. There
   existed obvious differences in the dormancy and germination
   characteristics between the two seed morphs (black and brown) of S.
   aralocaspica under the stresses of NaCl and Na2SO4. The black seeds had
   a lower germination rate than the brown seeds, were of non-deep
   physiological dormancy, and their germination rate could be increased
   after 15/30 degrees C alternating temperature, 30 days of cold
   stratification at 4 degrees C, and 800 mg.L-1 of GA(3) treatment. Salt
   and alternating temperature treatments could significantly affect the
   seedling emergence rate and establishment rate of brown seeds, but had
   lesser effects on black seeds, indicating that the black seeds could
   have persistent slow-germination mechanism, being favorable for the
   formation of persistent seed bank. All the results showed the
   adaptability Of S. aralocaspica to saline environment in early spring.

   breaking treatments. chilling. chilling + gibberellic acid. gibberellic
   acid and Mechanical scarification were used to determine whether they
   could improve germination. Scarification was the only treatment which
   allowed germination. Scarification improved germination from 0%
   (control) to over 70%, and the median germination time was approximately
   4.1 d. A. tanguticus seeds therefore have a coat-imposed dormancy. and
   the hard seed coats act In preventing water absorption and gaseous
   exchange. These results provide a means to enhance seed germination and

   and hot pepper. Indices such as germination rate, germination index and
   synthetical effect index were measured and the major allelochemicals of
   hot pepper root exudates were identified using gas chromatographymass
   spectrometry. The results suggested that root exudates from hot pepper
   had allelopathic potential, which differed depending on the
   concentration of root exudates and the difference of the receiver
   vegetables. Through the analysis of synthetical effect index, hot
   pepper, cowpea, cucumber and corn showed a stimulatory response to hot
   pepper root exudates under lower concentration, whereas they showed an
   inhibitory response under higher concentration. Hot pepper root exudates
   exhibited a positive effect on radish and tomato. However, this effect
   weakened with increasing concentration. Lettuce, Chinese cabbage and B.
   oleracea showed an inhibitory response under all concentrations. Eight
   kinds of allelochemicals were identified from the hot pepper root
   exudates. The main component of the allelochemicals was dibutyl
   phthalate, which may play an important role in allelopathy.

   stimulate embryo production did not affect embryo germination and
   plantlet formation. Three germination techniques were compared. Embryo
   dehydration or growth on Transfergel-solidified medium gave higher
   germination rates than chilling treatments. Most germinated somatic
   embryos produced secondary embryos from the hypocotyl after a few weeks
   of culture. Regardless of the germination technique, the plantlet

AB This research was performed to develop mass propagation method of
   round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia L.) for improving
   horticultural usefulness. Seeds were collected around Hwaseong-si,
   Gyeonggi-do in October of 2011 and experimented upon while being
   dry-stored at 4 ± 1.0℃ (darkness). Seed length of a major and minor axis
   were 1.58 ± 0.060 and 0.21 ± 0.016 ㎜, respecrively, and weight of 1,000
   seeds was 6.24 ± 0.172 ㎎. Seeds were thus classified as ‘dwarf seeds’.
   Regarding the dormancy type, since round-leaved sundew seeds were
   dormancy broken and germinated at 20~30℃ under the light condition after
   wet-chilling treatment for 12 weeks, seeds were estimated to have
   physiological dormancy.Germination conditions of dormancy broken seeds
   were found to be 20℃ and light condition (54.7%), but germination
   decreased at higher temperature. Percent germination (PG), germination
   energy (GE), mean germination time (MGT) and T50 were effectively
   improved by chemical treatment such as GA3 200 ㎎/L + kinetin 20 ㎎/L and
   wet-chilling treatment for 14 weeks. In conclusion these optimal
   conditions were thought to be a useful method for raising seedling

AB Given the medicinal and ornamental properties of Hawthorn (Crataegus
   spp.), and given that there are some problems in its propagation, which
   is due to the hard cover of the seeds and immature embryo, working out
   techniques that can facilitate the process of seeds' germination is of
   great import. Thus, the present study sought to identify the best method
   for the purpose of breaking the seed dormancy of 8 species of native
   hawthorn of Iran. The study was carried out as factorial with a
   completely randomized design and had three replications. The first,
   second and third factors were, respectively species of Hawthorn in eight
   levels, sulfuric acid in three levels (half and an hour versus
   non-treated (control)) and chilling treatment in three levels (90, 105
   and 120 days, respectively). The results showed that the highest
   percentage of germination (32%) and germination rate (9.1 day-1) were
   obtained under the interaction of sulfuric acid treatment for one hour,
   followed by a 120-day chilling period in C. turkestanica, which had a
   significant difference with other treatments. It is concluded that
   hawthorn seeds have deep endocarp and physiological dormancy. The
   interaction of Sulfuric acid treatment and moist chilling play an
   important role in increasing the percentage and speed of germination of
   Hawthorn seeds. Highlights:.

   germination, transplanting success, seedling mortality percentage and
   rate of seed germination. Treatment T6 (48 hrs+300 ppm GA3) yielded
   highest percentage, (84.00) of seed germination while the lowest
   percentage value (37.25) was recorded in T9 (72 hrs+300 ppm GA3)
   treatment and the transplanting success was also lowest in T9. The
   seedling mortality percentage was maximum (79.25) with T9 where as
   lowest percentage value (22.00) was observed for T6 treatment. It may be
   concluded that T6 treatment can be recommended for the better stand

AB Populations of wild chili pepper (Capsicum annuum var. glabriusculum)
   are a valuable genetic resource for agriculture and nutrition. Knowledge
   about the germination capacity is of great importance for its management
   and conservation. Therefore, we evaluated, in the laboratory, the
   distribution of variation among populations and plants in the
   germination percentage and mean germination time (T(50)) of four
   populations of wild C. annuum from northwest Mexico, at constant (25
   degrees C) and fluctuating temperatures (25/35 degrees C). Also the
   variation of seed weight and its relationship with the germination
   capacity was examined. Populations and plants within populations
   differed significantly in the germination percentage and T(50) in both
   conditions of germination. In the germination percentage, 15.72 % of the
   total variation was attributed to differences among populations, 55.61 %
   among individuals and 15.72 % within individuals. In T(50), 23.70 % of
   the total variation was found among populations, 45.04 % among
   individuals and 31.26 % within individuals. The differences in the
   germination capacity among the populations were not significantly
   correlated with the main climate factors of the collection sites;
   therefore, they should be considered independent reactions to the
   environmental conditions of their sites of origin. The weight of seeds
   varied significantly among and within populations; and positively and
   significantly correlated with the percentage of germination in the
   population Alcoyonqui and with T(50) in the population Yecorato
   Mezquite, but negatively with T(50) in the population Yecorato Camino.
   This indicates that the environment of growth of mother plants
   influences the capacity of germination and weight of wild C. annuum
   seeds.

AB Society is increasingly demanding a more sustainable management of
   agro-ecosystems in a context of climate change and an ever growing
   global population. The fate of crop residues is one of the important
   management aspects under debate, since it represents an unneglectable
   quantity of organic matter which can be kept in or removed from the
   agro-ecosystem. The topic of residue management is not new, but the need
   for global conclusion on the impact of crop residue management on the
   agro-ecosystem linked to local pedo-climatic conditions has become
   apparent with an increasing amount of studies showing a diversity of
   conclusions. This study specifically focusses on temperate climate and
   loamy soil using a seven-year data set. Between 2008 and 2016, we
   compared four contrasting residue management strategies differing in the
   amount of crop residues returned to the soil (incorporation vs.
   exportation of residues) and in the type of tillage (reduced tillage (10
   cm depth) vs. conventional tillage (ploughing at 25 cm depth)) in a
   field experiment. We assessed the impact of the crop residue management
   on crop production (three crops-winter wheat, faba bean and
   maize-cultivated over six cropping seasons), soil organic carbon
   content, nitrate (NO3-), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) soil content
   and uptake by the crops. The main differences came primarily from the
   tillage practice and less from the restitution or removal of residues.
   All years and crops combined, conventional tillage resulted in a yield
   advantage of 3.4% as compared to reduced tillage, which can be partly
   explained by a lower germination rate observed under reduced tillage,
   especially during drier years. On average, only small differences were
   observed for total organic carbon (TOC) content of the soil, but reduced
   tillage resulted in a very clear stratification of TOC and also of P and
   K content as compared to conventional tillage. We observed no effect of
   residue management on the NO3- content, since the effect of
   fertilization dominated the effect of residue management. To confirm the
   results and enhance early tendencies, we believe that the experiment
   should be followed up in the future to observe whether more consistent
   changes in the whole agro-ecosystem functioning are present on the long
   term when managing residues with contrasted strategies.

AB Grapes are usually propagated vegetatively, but reproduction by seed is

   variable. To examine the effects of berry ripeness at harvesting on
   germination, seeds of the cultivars Riesling * Silvaner and
   Blauburgunder were harvested on different dates during September-October
   1995; some of the Blauburgunder vines were defoliated and had some fruit
   clusters removed a few weeks before harvesting fruits. After harvesting,
   the seeds were removed from the fruits and the juice analysed for sugar
   concentration. Seeds were stratified and stored over the winter and sown
   in February 1996 in a greenhouse. The number of seedlings was counted at
   intervals from 16 to 53 days after sowing. A relationship between
   harvesting date and percentage germination was shown only by Riesling *
   Silvaner; germination increased with the delay in harvesting, but the
   relationship was weak (r=0.6) and the highest germination rate was only
   45%. Blauburgunder showed no significant correlation between the 2
   characteristics. Defoliation of Blauburgunder vines reduced fruit sugar
   concentration and seed germination. Seeds from defoliated plants showed
   a delay in the start of germination compared with those from
   non-defoliated plants, but by 53 days had caught up to the same value.

AB In grassy ecosystems of south-eastern Australia, fire maintains richness
   of native forbs. It is commonly thought that fire promotes regeneration
   indirectly by reducing competition for light and providing gaps for
   recruitment, rather than directly stimulating germination. However,
   physiological dormancy and morphophysiological dormancy are common, and
   few studies have explored responses to fire-cues among dormant or
   hard-to-germinate forbs. Recent studies from other fire-prone ecosystems
   suggest that in some cases, fire-cues may not alleviate physiological or
   morphophysiological dormancy, but instead promote germination in
   combination with treatments which alleviate dormancy. We experimentally
   tested the prevailing hypothesis that perennial forbs common in
   south-eastern Australian grassy ecosystems do not germinate in direct
   response to fire. Responses to fire-cues both inherently and in
   combination with treatments which alleviate dormancy were investigated
   for seven species. Two fire-cues (smoke and heat) plus a treatment of
   both heat + smoke were applied to fresh seed at three temperatures
   (35/25 degrees C, 30/20 degrees C and 25/15 degrees C). Following this,
   the effect of fire-cues on seed that had undergone warm stratification,
   cold stratification and dry-after-ripening was investigated. Three
   species - Arthropodium strictum, Cheiranthera cyanea and Dianella
   revoluta - responded to fire-cues inherently, although germination in C.
   cyanea was low. High germination of D. revoluta was found when fire-cues
   were combined with warm stratification. Fire-cues had no effect on
   germination of Brunonia australis, Burchardia umbellata and Eryngium
   ovinum. Germination of Stypandra glauca was zero following all treatment
   combinations. Our finding that fire-cues promote germination of three of
   the seven study species did not provide sufficient evidence to reject
   the current hypothesis that germination of perennial forbs is not
   typically promoted by fire-cues. However, this study highlights the
   important direct role fire-cues can play in promoting germination of
   some perennial forbs both inherently and in combination with treatments
   used to alleviate physiological dormancy.

   germination and vigour thereof. The changes in seed characteristics
   after harvesting and the germination rate of seed samples provided by
   SEVA-FLORA s.r.o., Valtice were tested. Laboratory tests were carried
   out in January - March 2009. In the first stage of the tests were used
   untreated seeds, and in the second phase the seeds were stratified by
   chilling during a period of 14 days at 6 degrees C. The results showed
   that treated seeds have a higher germination percentage as well as a
   higher speed of germination than seeds which were not treated. For
   example, in the variety Echinacea paradoxa (Norton) Britton var.
   paradoxa the germination percentage without chilling stratification was
   about 7 %, and in E. tennesseensis (Beadle) it was as low as 0.3 %.
   After stratification, the germination percentage increased to 22 % and 9
   % respectively. The germination rate of Echinacea purpurea (L.) seed
   samples of different age were tested too. In this case it was confirmed
   that the seed sample from 2008 had a significantly higher germination
   percentage than the seed sample harvested in 2001.

AB Seeds of P. zonale have a hard seed coat but contain non-dormant
   embryos. Scarified seeds were found to germinate within 1 to 2 days, the
   optimum temperature being 20 to 25 deg C in light and darkness. Within
   strains seeds with a water-permeable seed coat occur and there is a
   continuous transition from hard to 'soft' seed coat leading to
   differences in total germination and mean germination time in untreated
   seeds, the temperature optimum and start of germination being the same
   as in scarified seeds. In addition to the influence of the seed coat
   genetic differences in germinability of the embryos were observed. Seed
   treatment with sulphuric acid, gibberellic acid, hot water,
   stratification and freeze drying did not improve germination, and
   sulphuric acid was harmful to seeds with a permeable coat. In cvs and
   strains a correlation exists between the beginning of flowering and both
   the cumulative solar energy needed and the date of germination. There
   were significant differences between cvs and between strains with regard
   to solar energy requirement and, independent of the date of germination,
   with regard to the length of the period from germination to flowering.
   The best strains selected started to flower around 2 May following
   germination around 10 January.

   according to IDS method. The examined parameters included water content
   in the seeds, germination energy, mean germination time and germination
   capacity before the seed treatment, after its treatment by the tested
   methods and after drying. Results show that all the tested methods
   accelerate germination of seeds; cold stratification is the most
   efficient and recommended method for Scots pine and soaking of seeds in
   water is the most efficient and recommended for Norway spruce. The best
   results in spruce were also obtained with cold stratification
   (comparable with soaking in water) but the method is complicated,
   longer-lasting and more costly than soaking in water.

   Germination percentages of dehulled and unchilled seeds ranged from
   about 86 to 91% at temperatures between 10 and 35°C. The optimum
   temperature was between 15 and 25°. The base temperature for germination
   of unchilled seeds was 8.3°. Percentage germination was not improved by
   chilling, however, the germination rate was increased by chilling.
   Germination capacity at low water potential was compared with that of
   Andropogon spp. and sorghum. Critical water potentials for germination
   of Andropogon spp., Miscanthus spp. and sorghum were -1.31, -1.46 and
   -1.73 MPa, respectively. Miscanthus seed germination was inhibited in
   the dark and by UV, far red and blue light. Blue light was most
   inhibitory. The inhibitory effects of light were higher for seeds
   harvested from flat areas than those harvested from mountainous areas.
   Germination was inhibited by salinity, although seeds harvested from
   flat areas were more salt tolerant than those from mountainous areas.
   Germination was inhibited by heavy metals (Hg, Cd, Cu and Pb) and was
   decreased most by Cd and least by Pb. After 2 years storage at 4°,
   germination capacity was still high. After 6 months storage at ambient
   temperature germination capacity was significantly decreased, and no
   germination was observed after storage for 1 year at ambient

AB Perennial warm-season forage grasses can be valuable components of
   forage systems to improve animal performance in summer, but they are
   difficult to get established. Two germination tests and 2 field
   experiments were conducted to determine relationships between seed
   germination and field emergence. Chilled and unchilled seed of
   Andropogon gerardii, Bothriochloa caucasica, Sorghastrum nutans and
   Panicum virgatum were germinated at different temp. Unchilled seeds were
   sown in the field near Columbia, Missouri at approx. 2-week intervals
   from early Apr. to late June in 1982 and 1983. Germination indices
   obtained with chilled seed had higher correlation coeff. with field
   emergence than did those with unchilled seed. Germination percentage and
   germination rate index (GRI) of chilled seed at 25°C had the highest
   correlation, but germination indices at 30/20° were also closely related
   to field emergence percentage. With chilled seed, highest coeff. were
   observed between germination indices obtained at low temp. and emergence
   indices obtained with early sowings, and between germination indices
   obtained at high temp. and emergence indices obtained with late sowings.
   Germination percentage and GRI obtained from chilled seed germinated at
   25° made it possible to evaluate emergence potential of these 4
   perennial warm-season forage grasses over a range of field conditions.

AB Objective: Applicability of a seed-coating Bacillus subtilis suspension
   for promoting chili pepper seedling growth was investigated. Method: The
   chili pepper, Yangjiao No. 2, was used in the study by applying a B.
   subtilis agent on the seeds at the pharmacopoeia ratios of suspension to
   seeds at 1:2, 1:4, 1:6, 1:8, 1:10, or 1:12(ml:g). Subsequently, the seed
   germination as well as the seedling growth and physiological
   characteristics were monitored to determine the effects brought about by
   the coating treatments. Result: Compared with control, the coating
   increased the seed germination rate and the plant height, stem diameter,
   leaf area, plant dry weight, and growth index of the seedlings. The
   effects peaked at the suspension to seeds ratio at 1:8. The coating
   treatments enhanced the net photosynthetic rate(Pn), transpiration
   rate(Tr), and stomatal conductance(Gs) but reduced the intercellular CO2
   concentration(Ci) on the leaves resulting in an uplifted photosynthetic
   capacity of the plants. Moreover, the treatments decreased the MDA
   content and O2-production rate, while increased the SOD, POD and CAT
   activities, of the leaves that were conducive to sustaining high
   contents of chlorophyll and soluble protein for the plants. The seedling
   growth index was found positively correlated with the net photosynthetic
   rate, transpiration rate, and stomatal conductance but inversely
   correlated with the intercellular CO2 concentration. Conclusion: The
   seed-coating B. subtilis suspension alleviated the peroxidation of
   membrane lipids and increased antioxidant enzyme activities with a
   sustained high photosynthetic capacity in the leaves benefiting a
   vigorous subsequent growth of the seedlings. The pharmacopoeia ratio at
   1 ml of suspension to 8 g of seeds provided the most desirable results.

AB Maize (Zea mays, L.) cultivation has expanded greatly from tropical to
   temperate zones; however, its sensitivity to chilling often results in
   decreased germination rates, weak seedlings with reduced survival rates,
   and eventually lower yields. We conducted germination tests on the
   maize-282-diverse-panel (282 inbred lines) under normal (25 degrees C)
   and chilling (8 degrees C) conditions. Three raw measurements of
   germination were recorded under each condition: 1) germination rate, 2)
   days to 50% germination, and 3) germination index. Three relative traits
   were derived as indicators of cold-tolerance. By using the 2,271,584
   single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the panel from previous
   studies, and genome-wide association studies by using FarmCPU R package
   to identify 17 genetic loci associated with cold tolerance. Seven
   associated SNPs hit directly on candidate genes; four SNPs were in high
   linkage disequilibrium with candidate genes within 366 kb. In total, 18
   candidate genes were identified, including 10 candidate genes supported
   by previous QTL studies and five genes supported by previous gene
   cloning studies in maize, rice, and Arabidopsis. Three new candidate
   genes revealed by two associated SNPs were supported by both QTL
   analyses and gene cloning studies. These candidate genes and associated
   SNPs provide valuable resources for future studies to develop
   cold-tolerant maize varieties.

   increased proline content by 57.39%, improved the activities of
   superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) by

   METHODS: The embryo formation process of the wild Corydalis yanhusuo was
   observed,and the germination rate of wild Corydalis yanhusuo seeds
   stored under different conditions was measured.
   RESULTS: The seed development of the wild Corydalis yanhusuo depended on
   the storage conditions. The seeds subjected to stratification had the
   highest germination percentage. Those stored in dry conditions would
   lose the vitality completely. The seeds in isothermal storage had very
   low germination rates. As revealed by slices, only the seeds after
   stratification treatment had the ability to form a complete embryo.
   CONCLUSION: The Corydalis yanhusuo seed is a kind of seed without fully
   developed embryo, and needs further after-ripening for its development.
   Its vitality has a great seasonal and annual dependence.

   germination if still stored at 4AAAFchilling stratification for 10
   months more, roots were often injured and unable to become seedlings.
   The seeds dormancy of Lithocarpus lepidocarpus is closely related to

   Tien area, were cultured on MS medium supplemented with growth
   regulators for three years. The Pasania dodonaeifolia Hayata seeds
   produced both non-embryogenic callus and embryogenic callus .
   Embryogenic callus tissue came out for two types: direct embryo and
   indirect embryo. On the average, it took about50-60 days from the
   beginning of embryo culture to obvious somatic embryogenesis. Take the
   AAA~Kuei Tien No. 1AAA seed for example, the germination rate was 19.8%.
   Root emerged after the seed was cultured for 30 days, shoots came out
   after 50 days, and normal leaves and twigs grew out after 70 days.
   Husked Seeds whose diameter was from 4 mm to 12 mm could induce both
   embryogenic and non-embryogenic callus tissues; the seeds whose diameter
   was smaller than 3 mm would die after being culture. Seeds were viable
   only for 3 month after cold stratification. When BA and NAA were used in
   a 4X6 factorial design experiment, the concentration of NAA
   significantly influence rooting and embryogenic callus formation, and
   the most efficacious formulas were 1 mg/L NAA with 0.1 to 1 mg/L BA.
   Seed diameter and collection area also significantly influence the
   performance of tissue culture.

AB The Nymphoides peltata population expands quickly in Lake Taihu, China.
   One question addressed in this study is whether the seeds of N. peltata
   contribute to this expansion. The buoyancy and germination of N. peltata
   seeds and the development of N. peltata seedlings were studied, using
   seeds collected from Lake Taihu. The results indicated that a low wind
   velocity of 2.4-3.0 m s(-1) had a slightly negative effect on seed
   buoyancy. After 19 and 67 h of gentle stirring, 50% and 90%,
   respectively, of the N. peltata seeds had sunk. Few seeds floated again
   after sinking, but these refloating seeds sank soon with the
   disturbance. The N. peltata seeds did not germinate without
   stratification, but the stratification of seeds for a two-week period
   resulted in a high germination rate (63.3%) at a light intensity of 20
   mu mol photons m(-2) s(-1). Both the light and stratification treatments
   stimulated the seeds germination. The seeds did not germinate in
   sediment at depths greater than 0.25 cm. A high germination rate (74%)
   was observed for the seeds that laid on the water-sediment interface;
   however, nearly all of the germinated seeds floated on the water surface
   after germination. Only a small fraction (14%) of the buoyant seedlings
   could re-establish in shallow water (less than 3 cm). In the eighth week
   of the experiments, the buoyant seedlings that failed to re-establish
   rotted. When grown in low light intensity conditions, the N. peltata
   seedlings had smaller cotyledons, shorter primary roots, and weak
   development of adventitious roots. Sufficient light was important for
   both seed germination and seedling development. It was found that sexual
   reproduction is likely to have little direct contribution to the rapid
   expansion of N. peltata towards the centre of this large shallow lake.

   evaluated for Digitaria nuda. Stored and fresh seeds were pre-treated
   with either 0.02 M KNO3, soaked in water for 24 h (priming), sterilized
   with 0.5% NaOCl or heat treated at 60 degrees C. Seeds were germinated
   at constant temperatures of 25 and 30 degrees C and fluctuating
   temperature regimes of 25/10 and 30/15 degrees C. The effect of
   pre-chilling on germination of stored and fresh seed was evaluated at
   30/15 degrees C, and seed emergence in two soil types at different
   burial depths (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 cm) was also determined. The
   pre-treatment of stored seed with KNO3 resulted in the highest
   germination percentage (100%), whereas the pre-treatment of fresh seed
   with water for 24 h gave the best germination (99%), at constant
   temperatures of 25 and 30 degrees C. Pre-chilling of seed increased
   germination by more than 30%. Emergence from clay loam soil was greater
   compared with the emergence from sandy loam soil. Total seedling
   emergence decreased exponentially with increasing burial depths with
   only 5% of seed germinating from a burial depth of 6 cm. Results from
   this study showed that germination requirements are species specific and
   knowledge of factors influencing germination and emergence of grass weed
   seed can assist in predicting flushes in emergence allowing producers to
   implement control practices more effectively. (C) 2013 SAAB. Published

   Effects of osmoconditioning on the growth of Italian ryegrass and
   sorghum in suboptimal conditions were measured. The results obtained are
   summarized as follows: Seedlings of Italian ryegrass were severely
   affected by drought stress, while sorghum seedlings got stress under
   humid tension. Osmoconditioned seeds of Italian ryegrass showed good
   establishment and increased dry matter yield by four or six percentages
   and PEG treated sorghum yielded 4-16% more than non-treated.
   Osmoconditioned sorghum plants were accelerated in growth and yielded
   16% more under chilling condition with no effect of osmoconditioning in
   Italian ryegrass. Italian ryegrass showed a strikingly superior salt
   stress-resistance by osmoconditioning yielding 32% more dry matter than

AB Following storage of field-collected seeds of B. tripartita under
   dry-room temperature, dry-low temperature, wet-low temperature or
   dry-high temperature conditions, no seeds germinated in a growth chamber
   with a 14-h photoperiod up to 35 days after storage. However, some seeds
   stored under wet-room temperature conditions germinated after 25 days of
   storage. This could have been due to the fact that the seed coats were
   damaged by fungi which developed during storage. Seeds stored under
   wet-low temperature conditions (stratification) began to be germinate
   after 3 months of storage. Germination rate increased with prolonged
   stratification, and almost all seeds had germinated after 9 months of
   stratification. These results suggest that dormancy of B. tripartita
   seeds relate to the seed coat and thus several attempts were made to
   induce seed germination through damaging or weakening the seed coat.
   Freezing (-20°C), drying (100°C) or swelling (40°C) of the seeds was not
   effective in inducing germination. Treatments of concentrated sulfuric
   acid, KNO3 or gibberellin to the seeds had no effect either. However,
   Ethrel [ethephon] had a stimulatory effect on seed germination, with an
   optimum concentration of 250 ppm. Seed cutting was also effective in
   inducing germination, but seedlings from the seeds had cut cotyledons.
   Germination of the stratified seeds varied with the temperature
   conditions to which they were subjected, but not with light. Germination
   rate was highest at 35-40°C. Although the seeds were not able to
   germinate under submerged conditions, seedlings older than the
   2-leaf-stage exhibited better growth under submerged or subirrigated
   conditions than under upland conditions. Among the herbicides tested,
   pyrazosulfuron-ethyl, linuron and bentazone were found to be effective
   for controlling B. tripartita, and were more effective when applied
   early.

AB To conserve a threatened plant species (Penthorum chinense Pursh) in
   Japan, seed germination responses to pretreatment (imbibition and/or
   chilled), temperature and light, and seed dispersal by water were
   examined. The seeds collected from abandoned paddy fields in a warm
   temperate region, central Japan, germinated in light (14 h photoperiod;
   light 22 degreesC, dark 21 degreesC) after a moist-chilled treatment.
   After this pretreatment, the seeds germinated well at 10-25 degreesC
   (optimum temperature 15 degreesC), but did not germinate in darkness
   even at the optimum temperature. Most of the seeds floated on distilled
   water, but 20-60% of the seeds that were collected from several
   populations sank in distilled water, indicating dimorphism in seed
   dispersal by water. The floating and sunken seeds did not show
   significant differences in weight and germination rate within a
   population. The addition of a surface-active agent in distilled water
   submerged the seeds, indicating that the buoyancy of the seeds is
   attributable to an oil coating on the seed surface that enhances the
   interfacial tension on the seeds. Three times the number of seeds sank
   in river water collected from a rural area than in distilled water. A
   greater number of seeds also sank in water that had increasing
   concentrations of linear alkylbenzenesulfonate, which is a major
   component of synthetic detergents. This suggests that the water
   dispersal of this species is suppressed by surface-active agents,
   including detergents, in river water.

   soil, i. e., September and October. The dormancy was gradually awakened
   during winter. Over 85 percent of the seeds had come out of dormancy by
   May. Under preservative conditions of different temperature and
   moisture, progress of dormancy awakening was different. Chilling in
   moist condition promoted the dormancy awakening most, which may be the
   most important environmental factor related to the dormancy awakening in
   winter. Effect of light and alternating temperature on germination was
   very different among various dormancy awakening phases. In the phase of
   deep dormancy no germination occurred under any conditions, but in the
   more progressed phase of awakening germination was promoted under light
   and daily alternating temperature conditions. Finally germination could
   be observed even under constant temperature and dark conditions in the
   completely awaked phase. Difference of dormancy awakening phase caused
   by various environmental conditions in the soil may be one of the
   factors that induce variation in germination time.

   gemmules of Eunapius; (ii) gemmules that develop non-synchronously,
   containing amphidisc spicules within the gemmular capsule and resembling
   those of Ephydatin. Algal cells were not detected within either type of
   gemmule although they exist in the developed sponges.
   2. Sponges began producing gemmules in the lake with the onset of lake
   drawdown and ceased when lake level was minimal. The gemmules hatched
   when the lake level began to rise.
   3. Under experimental conditions gemmules hatched between 13 and 35
   degrees C. Germination was optimal at 20-25 degrees C. Chilling of young
   gemmules prior to incubation at 25 degrees C improved germination rate.
   4. The percentage of germinating dry gemmules diminished 4-6 months
   after their collection from the lake. None germinated after 10 months.
   Submerged gemmules maintained high viability with ageing (up to 100%
   germination 18 months after collection). Desiccation influenced gemmule
   viability over time, by both decreasing the percentage of germinating
   gemmules and increasing the lag time before onset of germination.
   5. Gemmules kept in the dark germinated significantly less than those
   illuminated for 12 h day(-1).

   salicylic acid (SA, 50 mg L-1) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 2 mu M)
   alone or in combinations on germination and emergence of hybrid maize at
   12 degrees C and 25 degrees C. Untreated seeds were used as control. At
   optimum temperature, most of growth promoting substances significantly
   improved germination attributes while at low temperature, higher final
   germination percentage (FGP), germination index (GI) and reduced time to
   50% germination (T-50), mean germination time (MGT) were attributed to
   SWE+ASA, MLE+H2O2, ASA+H2O2, MLE+SWE+H2O2, MLE+SA+H2O2, ASA+SA+H2O2,
   MLE+SWE+ASA+H2O2 and SWE+ASA+SA+H2O2 priming treatments as compare to
   control and hydropriming. Higher shoot length, root length and seedling
   dry weights were also linked with these treatments at both the
   temperatures. However, in net house study, better emergence attributes
   and improved seedling performance was observed in seeds treated with
   MLE+H2O2 followed by SWE+ASA, SWE+ASA+SA+H2O2 and ASA+SA+H2O2 as
   compared to other priming treatments. Improved performance of maize
   seedlings was due to high alpha-amylase activity and sugar contents.
   Results revealed that these seed priming combinations were very
   effective in improving seed germination under cool conditions, while
   field appraisal of these combinations is imperative. (C) 2013 Friends

   (salt tolerant) were chilled at 3 degrees C for 2 weeks. The chilled,
   hydroprimed and non-primed (control) seeds of the two wheat cultivars
   were sown in both Petri dishes in a growth room and in the field after
   treatment with 15 dS m-1 NaCl salinity. Chilling was very effective in
   increasing germination rate and subsequent growth when compared with
   hydropriming and control under salt stress. Results from field
   experiments clearly indicated the efficacy of chilling over hydropriming
   in improving shoot dry biomass and grain yield in either cultivar,
   particularly under salt stress. This increase in growth and yield was
   related to increased net photosynthetic rate, greater potential to
   uptake and accumulate the beneficial mineral elements (K+ and Ca2+) in
   the roots and reduced uptake and accumulation of toxic mineral element
   (Na+) in the shoots of both wheat cultivars when grown under salt
   stress. Salt-stressed plants of both wheat cultivars raised from chilled
   seed had greater concentrations of indoleacetic acid, abscisic acid,
   salicylic acid and spermine when compared with hydropriming and control.
   Therefore, induction of salt tolerance by pre-sowing chilling treatment
   in wheat could be attributed to its beneficial effects on ionic
   homeostasis and hormonal balance. The results presented are also helpful
   to understand the chilling-induced cross adaptation of plants in natural
   environments. Moreover, efficacy of pre-sowing chilling treatment over
   hydropriming suggested its commercial utilization as a low risk priming
   treatment for better wheat crop production under stressful environments.

AB Magnolia punduana Hk. f. & Th. (syn. Michelia punduana) is a threatened
   tree species restricted to northeastern India. The seeds remain dormant
   for 6 months after dispersal. Seed development and breaking of dormancy
   was investigated in the present study. Physical treatments such as water
   (cold, hot, and boiling) and acid and manual scarification proved
   ineffective in breaking dormancy. Matured seeds had linear and
   underdeveloped embryos at the time of dispersal with an embryo to seed
   length (E:S) ratio of 0.13. Germinating seeds showed a significant
   increase in the embryo length with an E: S ratio of 0.36. Cold
   stratification (CS) at 5 degrees C effectively broke dormancy. The
   embryo grew significantly after CS, indicating the presence of "non-deep
   simple" morphophysiological dormancy (MPD). Application of GA(3) had a
   significant effect on germination and the lowest germination time with
   the shortest T-50 was observed in seeds treated with 3000 mg.L-1 GA(3).
   KNO3 did not have an influence on breaking dormancy except in
   combination with GA(3), which increased the germination percentage
   significantly. CS for 90 days and GA(3) (3000 mg.L-1) at 25 degrees C
   resulted in optimum germination. In the test for viability, seeds stored
   at 5 degrees C showed highest viability of 66.66% after 180 days.

AB Dorema ammoniacum D. Don. (Apiaceae) which is native to Iran is
   classified as a vulnerable medicinal species. The aim of this study was
   to enhance the germination of Dorema ammoniacum seeds, which have a low
   percentage under normal laboratory conditions. Different pretreatments
   were carried out to obtain efficacy in breaking dormancy and speeding
   germination, using of scarification, cold stratification, Washing and
   chilling treatments, gibberellic acid (GA3) and N6-benzyladenine (BA)
   treatments. The rate and percentage of seed germination varied with
   duration and medium of stratification. The highest germination
   percentage was obtained in the moist sand cold stratification for 45
   days (68.001.7). Both germination rate and percentage of Dorema
   ammoniacum increased by increasing the number of exposure days at 4°C.
   However, when the chilling temperature was decreased from 4 to -5 and
   -10°C, a negative response was monitored for both germination rate and
   percentage. Addition of GA did not promote germination. Regardless of
   applied treatment to seeds, germination rate was positively correlated
   with germination percentage. Therefore, fast germination was associated
   with high germination percentage. For the first time, these results
   indicated that Dorema ammoniacum seeds which have deep
   morphophysiological dormancy need a chilling treatment for reliable
   germination.

AB Plants from the group of evergreen deciduous shrubs used in landscaping
   practice in our country are not many. Ilex aquifolium L. is one of those
   plants. With its high decorative qualities and unpretentiousness to the
   environmental conditions, the plant deserves wider use. Problem in the
   production of seedlings is the deep peace of seeds and consequent low
   germination. This study was conducted to explore some possibilities for
   pre-sowing treatments of seeds of Ilex aquifolium L. and for increasing
   of their germination. They were used variations of soaking in tap, hot
   water and a solution of GA3 at concentrations of 0.5 or 1,0 gl-1. The
   seeds were stratified after different treatments. Were used seeds with
   or without pericarp. Stratification was done in pure washed river sand
   at a temperature of 4°C for 90 days. All treated seeds showed a higher
   rate of germination in comparison with the control. With the highest
   germination rate - 86.7 - were seeds treated with hot water and then
   stratified for 90 days. Treatment with GA3 without endocarp seeds showed
   a higher germination rate - 74.5% and the necessity of shortening the
   period of stratification in comparison with seeds with endocarp. It was
   established that soaking in a hot or tap water and the subsequent
   90-days stratification are applicable treatments that would result in
   practice of ornamental nurseries in our country.

AB Preservation and development of plant cover are major factors in the
   management of range ecosystems. Artemisia sieberi is one of the native
   dominant species of vast areas in the Irano-Turanian bioclimatic region.
   This species is very tolerant to drought stress and grazing pressure.
   Therefore, it can be used to rehabilitate degraded rangelands of dry
   areas within this region. Understanding the germination characteristics
   of this species is important for the conduction of revegetation
   projects. Seeds of A. sieberi were collected randomly from 20 plants of
   existing vegetation along 6 kilometers transect at Isfahan Kolah Ghazi
   National Park located at 51 degrees 45'E and 35 degrees 15'N. To pass
   the dormant period, seeds were pre-chilled for nine days at 0 to 5
   degrees C. Two germination experiments were conducted in complete
   factorial block design. Moisture stress test was carried out with 0,
   -0.2, -0.4 and -0.6 MPa treatments using polyethylene glycol (PEG)
   solutions in Petri dishes. The light treatment test was conducted with
   12 h light and dark versus a continual dark condition. Results indicated
   that, an increase in the drought level lead to a decrease in the
   percentage and rate of germination, plumule length and allometry ratios,
   whereas the radicle length increased. In comparison with the dark
   treatment, 12 h of light treatment increased the percentage of
   germination and radicle length, while allometry ratios and plumule
   length decreased. Continual dark treatment compared with the 12 h light
   and dark photoperiod significantly reduced radicle and increased plumule
   lengths. Drought tolerance of A. sieberi seeds during germination showed
   the high potential of this species for vegetation rehabilitation in dry
   regions.

AB Many critically endangered plant species exist in small, genetically
   depauperate or inbred populations, making assisted gene flow
   interventions necessary for long-term population viability. However,
   before such interventions are implemented, conservation practitioners
   must consider the genetic and demographic status of extant populations,
   which are strongly affected by species' life-history traits. In
   northwestern Europe, Juniperus communis, a dioecious, wind-pollinated
   and bird-dispersed gymnosperm, has been declining for the past century
   and largely exists in small, isolated and senescent populations.
   To provide useful recommendations for a recovery plan involving
   translocation of plants, we investigated genetic diversity and structure
   of populations in Belgium using four microsatellite and five plastid
   single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers.
   We detected no clonality in the populations, suggesting predominantly
   sexual reproduction. Populations exhibited high genetic diversity (H-e =
   0.367-0.563) and low to moderate genetic differentiation (F-ST <=
   0.133), with no clear geographic structure. Highly positive inbreeding
   coefficients (F-IS = 0.221-0.507) were explained by null alleles,
   population substructuring and biparental inbreeding. No isolation by
   distance was observed among distant populations, but isolation at close
   geographic proximity was found. Patterns were consistent with high
   historical gene flow through pollen and seed dispersal at both short and
   long distances. We also tested four pre-germination treatments among
   populations to improve germination rates; however, germination rates
   remained low and only cold-stratification treatments induced germination
   in some populations.
   To bolster population regeneration, introductions of cuttings from
   several source populations are recommended, in combination with in situ
   management practices that improve seedling survival and with ex situ
   propagation.

AB The ability of seeds to regenerate from soil seed banks has long been
   recognized as a key survival strategy for plants establishing new niches
   in highly variable climates of alpine environments. However, the
   fundamental aspects of evolutionary/selective forces for seed bank
   development in alpine ecosystems are largely unknown. Here, we developed
   a model that describes dormancy, a high temperature requirement and a
   specific light/darkness regime at the time of seed shedding can preclude
   autumn germination, thus contributing to seed persistence until the next
   growing season. The benefits of these factors synchronising germination
   with the growing season are reviewed. Additionally, the importance of
   climatic variations of maternal environment affecting some of these
   factors is also discussed. It is suggested that the environmental
   conditions during the growing season partly control the seed persistence
   and seeds that fail to germinate are carried over to the next season.
   Species that have small (< 3 mg) and round-shaped seeds tend to persist
   more easily in soil for over 5 years, than do the large or flat seeds.
   However, some large-seeded species also have the potential to establish
   short-term persistence bank. A literature survey reveals 88 % of the
   alpine seeds have a mass < 3 mg. Seed size has only a weak relationship
   with mean germination timing (MGT) indicating that reduced persistence
   in large-seeded species cannot be counteracted by quicker germination,
   but combined effects of other factors stimulating germination remain an
   open area to be studied. It is proposed that long distance dispersal
   (LDD) is limited in most-but not all-species, primarily due to the
   absence of specialized dispersal structures. However, among numerous
   dispersal modes, most species tend to be dispersed by wind. Thus,
   spermatophytes of alpine environments have a greater tendency to
   establish seed banks and spread the risk of germination to many years,
   rather than being dispersed to other micro-climates.

AB Veronicastrum sibiricum is a perennial species distributed in Korea,
   Japan, Manchuria, China, and Siberia. This study aimed to determine the
   requirements for germination and dormancy break of V. sibiricum seeds
   and to classify the kind of seed dormancy. Additionally, its class of
   dormancy was compared with other Veronicastrum and Veronica species. V.
   sibiricum seeds were permeable to water and had a mature embryo during
   seed dispersal. In field conditions, germination was prevented by
   physiological dormancy, which was, however, relieved by March of the
   next year, allowing the start of germination when suitable environmental
   conditions occurred. In laboratory experiments, the seeds treated with
   0, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of cold stratification (4 degrees C) germinated
   to 0, 79, 75, 72, and 66%, respectively. After the GA(3) treatment
   (2.887 mM), >= 90% of the seeds germinated during the four incubation
   weeks at 20/10 degrees C. Thus, 2.887 mM GA(3) and at least two weeks at
   4 degrees C were effective in breaking physiological dormancy and
   initiating germination. Therefore, the V. sibiricum seeds showed
   non-deep physiological dormancy (PD). Previous research, which
   determined seed dormancy classes, revealed that Veronica taxa have PD,
   morphological (MD), or morphophysiological seed dormancy (MPD). The
   differences in the seed dormancy classes in the Veronicastrum-Veronica
   clade suggested that seed dormancy traits had diverged. The results
   provide important data for the evolutionary ecological studies of seed
   dormancy and seed-based mass propagation of V. sibiricum.

AB Seed germination in sweet cherry (Prunus avium L.) is a slow and lengthy
   process which has delayed breeding efforts. In this study, seed from
   ripe fruit of the sweet cherry cultivar 'Lambert' were collected and,
   after removing the endocarp, various dormancy-breaking treatments such
   as seed washing, the application of exogenous gibberellic acid (GA(3)),
   or cold stratification were evaluated for their ability to enhance the
   percentage and rate of seed germination. The results indicated that seed
   washing was necessary to break dormancy in sweet cherry. The seed
   germination percentage and rate improved to 26.5% and 1.17 seed d(-1)
   simply by washing the seed for 24 h. The application of up to 500 mg
   l(-1) GA(3), in addition to a seed washing treatment, further improved
   both the seed germination percentage and rate to 47.1% and 1.9 seed
   d(-1), respectively. Although the seed germination percentage improved
   as a result of 6 weeks of cold stratification, a longer cold period (8
   weeks) was required to obtain the maximum rate of germination. The
   application of higher concentrations of GA(3) and longer periods of cold
   storage did not result in further improvements in the seed germination
   percentage or rate. The highest germination percentage (61.2%) was
   obtained following seed washing for 24 h, followed by 500 mg l(-1) GA(3)
   treatment, then 6 weeks of cold stratification, which was higher than
   the germination percentage in the control treatment (0%). The highest
   rate of seed germination was observed following 24 h of seed washing,
   then 1,000 mg l(-1) GA(3) treatment and 8 weeks of cold stratification
   (3.8 seed d(-1)), but this combined treatment did not differ
   significantly (P <= 0.05) from seed washing, 1,000 mg l(-1) GA(3), and 6
   weeks of cold stratification (3.6 seeds d(-1)).

   The objective of this study was to determine the effects of peanut seed
   priming on seed germination and vigor under optimal and low temperature
   conditions before and after 9 months of storage. Tainan 9 peanut seeds
   were primed with salicylic acid (SA), ascorbate (ASA), CaCl2, or
   chitosan and tested for germination at 25 degrees C (optimal
   temperature) and 15 degrees C (low temperature) before and after a
   9-month storage period. Seed priming with 50 mg.L-1 SA and 50 mg.L-1 ASA
   for 12 hours before germinating improved germination at 15 degrees C
   when compared to untreated seeds both before and after 9-month storage.
   The high seed quality, illustrated by high germination percentage, high
   seed vigor, and low mean germination time related to the low
   autoxidation substrates: lipoxygenase (LOX), malondialdehyde (MDA), and
   high antioxidants: superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). It
   suggests that peanut seed priming with salicylic acid and/or ascorbate
   can improve seedling emergence and growth under low temperature
   conditions.

   the effect of reduced seed moisture content (m.c.) on the rate of
   dormancy breakage and radicle protrusion was carried out. Reduced m.c.
   delayed radicle protrusion and reduced the fraction of germinated seeds.
   At 33% m.c, fresh weight basis (f.w) no radicle protrusion was seen even
   after a prolonged period at +4 degrees C. Germination capacity (GC), and
   mean time to germination (MGT), were calculated from seeds prechilled at
   eight m.c, levels for different durations and then germinated at 25
   degrees C. Reduced m.c, resulted in a decrease in the rate of dormancy
   breaking, quantified as a lower increase in GC or lower reduction in MGT
   during the first weeks of prechilling, The critical lower m.c. threshold
   for dormancy breaking was around 23%. Combining the results it was
   concluded that prechilling of Abies nordmanniana seeds at a controlled
   m.c. of 33% allowed the release of dormancy in all seeds in the seedlot
   without any germination during the prechilling treatment. By introducing
   a higher degree of control the new method means improved germination
   capacity and an easier and more reliable dormancy breaking method.

AB Dormant seeds of sour cherries (Prunus cerasus) normally require warm
   stratification for 2 weeks followed by cold stratification for 15-18
   weeks to germinate. Seed treatments that reduce time to germination and
   increase germination percentages are important in breeding programmes
   and different experimental approaches to speed up germination were
   therefore investigated in this study. Removal of endocarps from dry or
   moist seeds resulted in high germination percentages after 2-4 months
   chilling and normal seedling growth. Dormant seeds with testa did not
   germinate at all at 20 degrees C. Up to half of dormant excised embryos
   germinated at 20 degrees C, but these showed abnormal seedling growth.
   Removal of the distal two-thirds of the cotyledons from dormant embryos
   gave 50 to 60% germination after two weeks at 20 degrees C and seedlings
   grew normally. Excised dormant embryos soaked in 10 or 200 mg l(-1) BAP
   for 30 min gave 70-80% germination at 20 degrees C and seedlings grew
   normally, except for more lateral branches than in seedlings from
   chilled seeds. Soaking seeds with testa in the same concentrations of
   BAP for 24 h only improved germination slightly. The study showed that
   both endocarp, testa and embryo contributed to seed dormancy in sour
   cherry and that embryonic dormancy was caused by inhibitors in the
   cotyledons. Removal of part of the cotyledons or external application of
   BAP to excised embryos eliminated the block to germination and allowed
   normal growth of seedlings. High germination percentage and normal
   seedling growth may thus be achieved after only few weeks compared to
   traditional stratification and germination after 4-6 months.

AB Several presowing seed treatments have been used to facilitate the seed
   germination and seedling emergence.The study was performed to design a
   model of presowing seed treatments in Taraxacum platycarpum. Germination
   and seedling growth responses to temperature, drying, chilling, GA3 and
   priming were investigated to know the optimum germination conditions and
   presowing treatment. The optimum temperature condition for germination
   and seedling growth were 15~20℃ at dark condition. The seeds exposed to
   infra red light, however, did not germinate. The moisture content of
   seeds dried at 35℃ for 3.5 hours was returned to the level of unimbibed
   seeds. The germination of seeds dried under dark condition was better
   than those dried under infra red light. Prechilling treatment imposed
   for 6 weeks showed higher germination rate than GA3 treatment or
   priming. In field test, the highest field emergence was observed in the
   seeds dried after prechilled for 6 weeks and followed by drying followed
   by GA3 > low temperature > KNO3 priming. Imbibition with 0.1 mM
   GA3solution for 2 hours then drying at 35 for 3.5 hour under dark
   condition was effective to the practical presowing treatment for
   Taraxacum seeds.

AB The abnormal seedlings, a common physiological anomalies, emerged during
   embryo rescue severely restricted grape breeding. To enhance the
   efficiency of the seedless grape breeding by reducing the production of
   abnormal seedlings in the course of embryo rescue, we investigated the
   effects of genotype, media type, embryo style, pre-chilling on the
   deformity rate of the abnormal seedlings during embryo rescue. The
   abnormal seedlings were firstly classified into seven categories based
   on their morphology. Our results indicated that the emergence of
   abnormal seedlings was highly dependent on the female parent genotype.
   Polyembryony was advantageous to diminish the number of abnormal
   plantlets and the germination rate of embryo was 100%. We also found
   that pre-chilling treatment could reduce the number of abnormal
   plantlets and promote the embryo germination. The abnormal plantlets
   were reduced significantly by the addition of ZnSO4 10 mu mol.L-1 or
   mashed-banana 500 mg.L-1 to either embryo development or germination
   media. Transferring the abnormal seedlings onto the suitable fresh media
   in 4 weeks after embryo germination provided an effective way to
   transform them into normal seedlings.

   of germinated seeds per day, especially on the seventh day after
   planting until the twelfth day, where the germination time was reduced
   with intensity and time of exposure to the electromagnetic field

   during cold stratification were studied with enzyme linked immunosorbent
   assay(ELSA), the relationship between endogenous hormone content and
   seed dormancy and germination was analyzed. The result showed that: (1)
   IAA content in seeds dropped in the early phase of cold stratification,
   but that rebounded after brief continuant time,and the variation of
   IAA/ABA was the same. ABA content in seeds was high before cold
   stratification,but as the extension of treatment time that tended to
   fall. Both GA(1/3) content and GA(1/3)/ABA were gradually increasing
   with the delay of the low-temperature stratification time. Variations of
   both ZRs and iPAs contents showed a smooth and steady situation,they
   trended to increasing despite some fluctuations. (2)The seeding
   experiment showed that the time of low-temperature stratification has
   important effects on seeds germination. Germination rate and germination
   potential of seeds without the low-temperature stratification treatment
   and these of processing time was less than 90 d were zero, the two index
   rose as the extension of stratification time. Thus effect of
   stratification time on seed germination of C. macro phylla seeds was
   obvious. (3)The results of correlation analysis between endogenous
   hormone and germination indexes showed that there were significantly
   positive correlation(P<0. 05) between GA(1/3) and germination rate,
   germination potential, and the correlation coefficients were 0. 688 and
   0. 662, respectively. Increase of GA(1/3)/ABA could promote the
   releasing dormancy and germination of C. macro phylla seeds.

AB Betula platyphylla var. japonica and Betula ermanii segregate vertically
   at an elevation of approximately 1,850 m on Mt. Neko in Nagano
   Prefecture, Japan. B. platyphylla var. japonica and B. ermanii were the
   dominant species below and above this altitude, at which the mean-annual
   and growing-season air temperatures were 4 degrees C and 14.1 degrees C,
   respectively. Based on a modification of Kira's warmth index which
   employs cumulative temperature represented as degrees C day, leaf
   unfolding in both species was observed to be initiated at 58 degrees C
   day and 169 degrees C day, respectively. In 1996, leaf unfolding was
   initiated on 18 May in B. platyphylla var. japonica (+/-6 days) and on 5
   June in B. ermanii (+/-8 days), shortly after the last frost which
   occurred on 5 May 1995 above 1,850 m; below this elevation there was no
   risk of frost at the time. At elevations above 1,850 m, the unfolded
   leaves of B. platyphylla were damaged by late frost, while B. ermanii
   escaped injury because the leaves were still protected by winter buds.
   The optimum temperature for seed germination in both B. platyphylla and
   B. ermanii was 30 degrees C. Temperature alternation from 10 to 30
   degrees C and moist storage of seeds at 4 degrees C (stratification)
   prior to incubation increased germination rates in both species. The
   seedlings of B. ermanii had a greater survival rates than those of B.
   platyphylla var. japonica when planted above 1,850 m. Comparisons of the
   timing of leaf unfolding and the latest frost at a site appeared to be
   the main factors affecting the vertical distribution of these species.

   inhibited 85.25% of radial growth of C. capsici followed by 78.53%
   leaves crude extract in chloroform and 73.58% leaves crude extract in
   acetone at the concentration of 10 mu g/ml (p < 0.05). The exact
   concentrations that had definite potential to fully restrict the growth
   (100% inhibition) of C. capsici (MIC) by P. betle was 12.50 mu g/ml in
   methanol, 17.50 mu g/ml in chloroform and 15.00 mg/ml in acetone. The
   sporulation assay also revealed that, P. betle leaves crude extracts
   showed the highest inhibition of spore germination rate of C. capsici
   overall at the concentration of 10 mu g/ml; with 80.93% inhibition by
   leaves crude extracts in methanol, 74.09% by leaves crude extracts in
   chloroform and 72.91% by leaves crude extracts in acetone. Concentration
   of plant leaves crude extracts that inhibited 50% or more of the radial
   growth and sporulation was considered as effective (LC >= 50). As a
   conclusion, the leaf crude extracts that exhibited effectiveness by
   showing more than 50% inhibition against C. capsici should be considered
   for further evaluation. P. betle leaf crude extracts was the most
   effective in inhibiting the fungus respectively and thus, exhibited the
   highest potential as a new leading biofungicide in the agriculture
   field.

AB Soil temperatures above 15-17°C may be common at planting time in
   western Oregon, and can severely limit seed germination of the cultivar
   Mermaid. Effects of three temperature regimes (constant 9°C; and
   alternating 15/3 and 18/6°C on 8/16 h cycles), two levels of KNO3 (0 and
   1 g/litre) and two seed pre-conditioning treatments (chilling for 48 h
   at 1°C, and no chilling) on germination were tested for the older
   cultivar Mermaid, the new cultivar Floral and some newer lines developed
   through selection for high oil yield. All lines tested were derived
   originally from the cross L. floccosa * L. alba. Seedling emergence of
   all entries was also measured in the field. Seed germination varied
   among genotypes under all temperature treatments; genotype by
   temperature regime interaction was not significant. Pre-chilling
   enhanced the initial germination rate of all genotypes, but had little
   effect on the final number of seeds germinated. The effects of KNO3 on
   seed germination varied among genotypes and among temperature regimes,
   suggesting genetic variation for seed dormancy. Results also indicate
   that primary and secondary seed dormancy have been reduced in Floral and
   in several of the new lines. Field emergence most closely correlated
   with germination under the 15/3°C regime with zero KNO3 and no
   pre-chilling. Selection from existing elite breeding lines for further
   reductions in dormancy (primary as well as secondary) and improvements
   of germination seems readily feasible and should contribute to
   meadowfoam commercialization.

PD 1994
PY 1994
AB Temperate conifer seeds are often considered to be shallowly dormant
   because a dormancy breakage treatment such as incubation of moist seeds
   at 4 degree C (prechilling) for 3-6 weeks improves germination. However,
   longer prechill durations can induce germination during the cold phase.
   Since the delicate radicles of prematurely germinated seeds are easily
   damaged and killed during sowing, potential benefits of extended
   prechilling are unknown. Described here for the first time is a target
   moisture content (TMC) prechill. In this dormancy breakage method the
   seeds are chilled at moisture contents high enough for removal of
   dormancy but low enough to produce surface dry, free flowing seeds that
   do not germinate during chilling. The method is a simple, effective and
   practical way to restrict the amount of water available to seeds from
   the start of a prechill treatment. The TMC prechill was applied to three
   conifer species, Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirbel) Franco),
   Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Douglas), and Sitka spruce (Picea
   sitchensis (Bongard) Carriere). All three species benefited from the TMC
   prechill. Extending the prechill period progressively improved
   germination by widening the range of temperatures over which germination
   occurred, raising germination capacity at most temperatures and
   increasing germination rate at all temperatures. The optimum prechill
   period combining high germination capacity and low mean germination time
   was 36 weeks for Douglas fir, from 36 to 76 weeks for Lodgepole pine and
   36 or 76 weeks for Sitka spruce depending on incubation temperature.
   None of the seeds of any of the species germinated during the TMC
   prechill of up to 76 weeks at 4%C.

AB Seed dormancy in Betula nana was broken both by cold stratification and
   by treatment with GA. With Empetrum hermaphroditum seed dormancy was
   also broken by G A. Germination in the dark of Ledum palustre seeds did
   not occur without GA treatment and GA increased the speed of germination
   in Kolkwitzia amabilis. Seed dormancy of K. amabilis at low temperatures
   (9°, 12° C.) was broken by GA treatment or by cold stratification. At
   the optimal temperature for germination, which varied between species,
   the germination rate and percentage were increased by GA treatment.
   Germination in Syringa amurensis var. japonica was also stimulated by GA
   at above-optimum temperatures but results with S. vulgaris varied from
   promotion to inhibition of germination. In preliminary trials it was
   shown that the degree of seed ripeness was directly related to response
   to GA.-Inst. Dendrol. Plantesk., Vollebekk, Norway.

AB The aim of this study is to investigate the dormancy in white henbane
   (Hyoscyamus albus L.) seeds which have low germination rate under normal
   laboratory conditions. To realize this, and in addition to the control
   non pretreated, two pretreatment were applied on H. albus L. seeds: the
   first one was a chemical scarification by soaking in 2% H2O2 solution
   for 10 min and the second was a cold stratification by soaking of seeds
   in hot water for few minutes then in the ice for one night. After
   disinfection of seeds, they were incubated in two types of sterile media
   in shides: Murashige and Skoog (MS) with different doses of Gibberellic
   Acid (GA3) (0, 0.625, 1.25 and 2.5 mg/l) or on water gel media (G). The
   cultures were put in the growth room at 25°C in darkness. After 48 h,
   the results showed that seeds pretreated with H2O2 have significantly
   germinated, when the highest percentage of germination was 75% on (G)
   compared to the control non pretreated, (12%) and the one that
   stratified witch presented a percentage of 18%. In order of germinated
   seeds on the same media. Seeds of control and seeds pretreated with
   stratification and that were incubated on MS media with different
   additions of GA3 have not germinated.

   The majority of the seeds for most of the studied taxa are non-dormant,
   Seeds of Micromeria cypria, salvia veneris, and Teucrium divaricaim ssp.
   canescens germinate in a narrow range of cool temperatures (10-20
   degrees C) and at a slow rate. These characteristics are common in
   Mediterranean species, and favor germination after species growing at
   high altitudes, germinate at even lower temperatures and with a
   considerably lower germination rate. In both species, treatment with
   GA(3) is effective in enhancing germination at unfavorable temperatures,
   while chilling is effective only for S. willeana. Sideritis cypria seeds
   germinate promptly at a relatively wider temperature range (10-25
   degrees C). Germinability in Teucrium divaricatum ssp. canescens can be
   enhanced by treatments with nitrates, GA(3), and light. The different
   germination behaviors detected are discussed in relation to the survival
   strategy of each species. The data presented in this paper provide
   useful information for the conservation of these endemic, rare, and
   threatened aromatic taxa of Cyprus.

   viability and germination percentages, the seeds of the selected P.
   khinjuk types were first scarified with H2SO4 and then sown directly, or
   sown after treatment with GA(3), or sown after stratification. Seedling
   growth and development, stem height and stem diameter were measured at
   15 day intervals during the growth period. There were no significant
   differences among the selections in the viability of the seeds. Seed
   germination rate under the three treatments ranged between 40% (B-3382)
   and 96% (B-56A1). The highest germination rates were in the
   stratification treatment whereas the lowest germination rates were in
   the directly sown treatment. The highest stem diameter was obtained in
   the B-56A1 type in the stratification treatment. Since the
   stratification treatment gave the best results, it was assumed that
   GA(3) application could substitute for stratification. B-56A1 and B-5602
   were found to have the highest germination and growth rates.

   embryos on full-strength Murashige and Skoog's medium (MS) containing 20
   g/L sucrose in comparison to McCown and Lloyd's Woody Plant Medium
   (WPM). Germination rates decreased when the sucrose concentration was
   lower or higher than 20 g.L-1. WPM/MS medium containing glucose at
   levels 30, 20, 15 g.L-1 showed a smaller percentage of germination and
   at quarter strength, WPM/MS medium with glucose did not respond.
   Multiple shoot formation was found at 1.0-2.0 mg/L BAP; 3.0 mg/L Kn; 2.0
   mg/L TDZ on MS medium with 20 g.L-1 sucrose. Germination rates improved
   when the embryos were placed upright (vertically) in the medium. The in
   vitro germinated seedlings were acclimatized in a walk-in-chamber and
   maintained in the green house with the survival rate of 65%-75%. These
   plants were transferred to the field and were found to be phenotypically
   normal, healthy and similar to donor plants. This protocol will be
   useful to overcome seed dormancy and for rapid multiplication and
   conservation of S. potatorum using zygotic embryo culture.

   its effects on growth and stress adaptation of plants, no detailed
   studies have been performed using center dot OH in germination and early
   seedling growth under abiotic stresses. Here we report a single seed
   treatment with center dot OH on germination and seedling growth
   ofArabidopsisand rice under non-stressed (ambient) and various
   abiotic-stressed conditions (chilling, high temperature, heat, and
   salinity). The treatment resulted in faster seed germination and early
   seedling growth under non-stressed conditions, and, interestingly, these
   effects were more prominent under abiotic stresses. In
   addition,Arabidopsisseedlings from treated seeds showed faster root
   growth and developed more lateral roots. These results show a positive
   and potential practical use for center dot OH in model and crop plants
   for direct seeding in the field, as well as improvement of tolerance
   against emerging stresses.

AB Wild pear (Pyrus glabra) is an endemic and medicinally important
   endangered plant species of Zagros Mountain. Interventions on behalf of
   conservation are necessary to protect this species. The seeds show very
   low germination (%), and these low rates represent a major obstacle to
   successful regeneration. In this study, the viability, germination (%),
   germination rate, pattern of germination and enzymes activities during
   seed germination under cold stratification were assessed. The
   experimental treatments used were cold stratification (CS), CS with cool
   water for 24 h, CS with gibberellic acid at 1000 ppm and at 1500 ppm for
   48 h. The mean seed viability was 42.251.9%. The highest germination
   rate was obtained under cold stratification for a period of 50 days. The
   activity of catalase was low during germination. Peroxidase activity
   increased with increasing periods of CS. Amylase activity was always
   high compared to the other enzymes, which showed a limited range of
   variation. The best time for germination could be inferred by
   determining the time at which the enzymatic activities are equal. The
   study found that the seed dormancy of the wild pear is of the
   morphological type. The embryo needs a 50-day cold period at a
   temperature of 5°C to begin germination. The study demonstrated that the
   low regeneration rate of this species is caused by the low percentage of
   viable seeds.

   and the effects of red light, far red light, phytohormones and nitric
   oxide on seed germination. Germination percentage of seeds decreased
   with both rapid and slow dehydration, and the damage caused by rapid
   dehydration was less than that caused by slow dehydration. Waterlettuce
   seeds were not sensitive to 4 degrees C storage. Germination percentage
   of seeds was zero in the dark and in far red light (FR) conditions, but
   was promoted by white light, red light (R) and up to three 12 h R/12 h
   dark daily photoperiods. White light was much more effective than R in
   promoting germination, and the stimulating effect of R could be
   partially reversed by subsequent exposure to FR. In the dark,
   germination percentage of the seeds was not increased by 0.001 - 1 mM
   indole acetic acid, gibberellic acid or 6-benzyladenine, but it was
   increased by 0.001 - 1 mM ethrel and 0.001-2.5 mM sodium nitroprusside.
   Our results indicate that waterlettuce seeds have intermediate storage
   behavior and that germination is controlled by phytochromes.

AB This study was conducted to find out the effects of removing endosperm
   cap and seed coat opposite to the radicle tip of hot pepper seeds on
   early germination. Morphological changes during priming and germination
   were also observed using scanning electron microscopy. The endosperm was
   consisted of two distinct cell types in separated locations within the
   seeds, the endosperm cells at the micropylar end of the seed had thin
   wall, but those except for the root cap had thick wall. Morphological
   changes in the endosperm opposite to radicle tip of seeds showed that
   the mechanical resistance of endosperm tissues was decreased by loss to
   2 layers of endosperm cells in the micropylar portion during the priming
   process (200 mM K3PO4 for 7 days at 20degreeC). That of imbibed seeds
   were also slightly reduced. In primed seeds micropylar cavity was opened
   and radicle protrusion was observed, while in un-primed seeds there was
   no signal for germination 1 day after bedding at 25degreeC. Removal of
   endosperm cap stimulate early protrusion of radicle regardless of seed
   treatments, and its effect was more pronounced in un-primed seeds than
   in primed seeds. More than 50% of germination was observed about 0.9 day
   after bedding regardless of with or without ABA and germination
   temperature when endosperm cap was cut out. Small reduction in medium
   water potential or increase in medium NaCl delayed germination time, but

   percentage was reduced when the medium water potential was <-0.2 MPa at

   germination and reduced days to 50% of final germination (T50) in the
   presence of osmotic and salt stress conditions when compared to

AB Tetragonia tetragonides is a medicinal plant native to ocean sand soil
   of southern provinces and has significant effects on the prevention and
   curing of gastroenteric disorders. Despite of its popularity, supply of
   the plant has never met the level of demand because of the absence of an
   adequate culturing method.The present study, thereby, was conducted for
   classifying the plants with geographically different characteristics,
   studying growth habits, developing a new culturing method and
   establishing a large scale propagation system of selected superior
   individual plants. The study was also aimed for revealing optimum
   conditions for seed treatment, fertilization, and efficient culturing
   system and thereby, for utilizing the plant as a new income source for
   rural communities.The seed was elongated with size of 2.6 mm (width) ×
   1.8 mm (length). No difference in seed size was observed depending on
   different inhabitate. Each flower produced about 4.5~4.8 seeds.
   Germination rate was high for seeds matured for 40 days after
   fertilization, but deceased to 50% for seeds matured only for 20 or 30
   days.Seed dormancy lasted 6 months and seed storage at humid 5℃
   facilitated germination. Mechanical obstruct of seed germination was due
   to seed coat and removal of seed coat enhanced the germination rate.
   Optimum temp. for seed storage was 5℃, and high germination rate was
   maintained for 350 days. However, for stratification condition or at
   room temperature, germination was significantly reduced as storage time
   increasedOptimum treatment of plant growth regulators was soaking in GA3
   250 mg/L for 1 hr. The priming treatment with 50 mM Ca(NO3)2 at 20℃ for
   two days improved the seed germination with 10% compared to non-treated
   control.The treatment of 20% NaOCl for 3 hr. improved the seed
   germination rate up to 10% and 1 day ahead.

AB The present experiment was carried out to determine the effect of
   seed-coat softening by various chemicals, washing, chilling, and light
   treatment alone and in combination during desiccation of seeds on
   germination of gourd (Lagenaria siceraria Standl.) seeds. Potassium
   hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, acetone, acetonitrile, and acetamide were
   used as chemicals for the softening. Washing, prechilling, drying and
   light treatment of the softened seeds were done for a hour with tap
   water, for one or three weeks at 3℃, 12 hr at 35℃, and 14 hr a day at
   30℃ with red light illumination or darkness, respectively.
   FR-yongjadaemok and FR-kunghap were used as test cultivars. Seed-coat
   softening with 10% acetone and acetonitrile for 1 hour enhanced and
   accelerated seed germination compared to the other chemicals and water
   imbibition. KOH treated for the softening was necessary to increase the
   germination rate of seeds for following chilling, but acetone did not
   influence their germinability regardless of chilling. Washing the
   softened seeds in tap water increased the germination rate in comparison
   with no-washing. During desiccation of the seeds sequentially treated
   with the softening, washing and chilling, red light treatment showed
   higher germination rate than dark one, suggesting that red light
   treatment are necessary during desiccation.Key words － Gourd,

AB Background: Ornamental peaches cv. 'Yaguchi' (Prunus persica (L.)
   Batsch) can be propagated via seeds. The establishment of efficient seed
   treatments for early germination and seedling growth is required to
   shorten nursery and breeding periods. It is important, therefore, to
   identify potential candidate genes responsible for the effects of
   rinsing and chilling on seed germination. We hypothesized that longer
   rinsing combined with chilling of seeds can alter the genes expression
   in related to dormancy and then raise the germination rate in the peach.
   To date, most molecular studies in peaches have involved structural
   genomics, and few transcriptome studies of seed germination have been
   conducted. In this study, we investigated the function of key seed
   dormancy-related genes using next-generation sequencing to profile the
   transcriptomes involved in seed dormancy in peaches. De novo assembly
   and analysis of the transcriptome identified differentially expressed
   and unique genes present in this fruit. Results: De novo RNA-sequencing
   of peach was performed using the Illumina Miseq 2000 system. Paired-end
   sequence from mRNAs generated high quality sequence reads (9,049,964,
   10,026,362 and 10,101,918 reads) from 'Yaguchi' peach seeds before
   rinsed (BR) and after rinsed for 2 or 7 days with a chilling period of 4
   weeks (termed 2D4W and 7D4W), respectively. The germination rate of 7D4W
   was significantly higher than that of 2D4W. In total, we obtained 51,366
   unique sequences. Differential expression analysis identified 7752, 8469
   and 506 differentially expressed genes from BR vs 2D4W, BR vs 7D4W and
   2D4W vs 7D4W libraries respectively, filtered based on p-value and an
   adjusted false discovery rate of less than 0.05. This study identified
   genes associated with the rinsing and chilling process that included
   those associated with phytohormones, the stress response and
   transcription factors. 7D4W treatment downregulated genes involved in
   ABA synthesis, catabolism and signaling pathways, which eventually
   suppressed abscisic acid activity and consequently promoted germination
   and seedling growth. Stress response genes were also downregulated by
   the 7D4W treatment, suggesting that this treatment released seeds from
   endodormancy. Transcription factors were upregulated by the BR and 2D4W
   treatment, suggesting that they play important roles in maintaining seed
   dormancy. Conclusions: This work indicated that longer rinsing combined
   with chilling affects gene expression and germination rate, and
   identified potential candidate genes responsible for dormancy
   progression in seeds of 'Yaguchi' peach. The results could be used to
   develop breeding programs and will aid future functional genomic
   research in peaches and other fruit trees.

   for the duration of dormancy when stored under ambient conditions. The
   early maturing cultivars lost dormancy rapidly (63 days) than did the
   late maturing ones (84 days). Presoaking seeds with gibberellic acid
   (GA3), 2 chloroethyl phosphoric acid (CEPA) and potassium nitrate (KNO3)
   (100 and 200 ppm each) proved effective in releasing dormancy in all the
   cultivars. Presoaking seed treatments with GA3, CEPA and KNO3  reduced
   the mean time to germinate. The length and dry matter accumulation of
   radicle were higher than the untreated control at high temperature and
   low moisture conditions.

AB To understand germination timing in an ecological context, the response
   to environmental events that affect seed dormancy is central, and has to
   be combined with knowledge of germination responses to different
   circumstances. In this study, seed dormancy, germination and emergence
   phenology of six annual co-occurring weedy Asteraceae species were
   investigated. Three pre-treatments (warm and cold stratification, and
   dry storage) were tested as possible dormancy-affecting environmental
   events. Seeds were also sown outdoors. Species-specific differences were
   revealed in analyses. To facilitate general descriptions of dormancy
   patterns and germination preferences separately, condensed responses to
   the different possible dormancy-affecting treatments and relative
   germination in different environments were plotted, giving
   species-specific patterns. Most species exhibited decreased dormancy to
   two or three pre-treatments. Dormancy was most effectively reduced by
   cold stratification for three species (Guizotia scabra, Parthenium
   hysterophorus, Verbesina encelioides), by warm stratification for two
   (Bidens pilosa, Galinsoga parviflora) and by dry storage for one
   (Tagetes minuta). All species germinated more when provided with light
   than in continuous darkness. Temperature levels most suitable for
   germination varied from low (15/5-20/10 degrees C) for V. encelioides to
   high (25/15-30/20 degrees C) for B. pilosa. It is concluded that, even
   though the species have different dormancy patterns and germination
   preferences that suggest different possible distribution ranges, they
   achieve similar emergence timing in the field in environments with a
   pronounced dry period after dispersal and small annual temperature
   fluctuations.

   an endangered aquatic plant in Japan. Seeds had physiological dormancy,
   and final germination rate increased with an increasing period of cold
   stratification. Seeds of T. sinensis had an almost absolute requirement
   for aerobic conditions to germinate. Also, alternating temperatures
   significantly promoted germination regardless of light conditions,
   although final germination percentage was twice to four times higher in
   light under constant temperature conditions. Suitable sites for
   germination of T. sinensis appear to be shallow water with alternating
   temperatures and sufficient oxygen and sediment anoxia, caused by
   eutrophication of water bodies, may have prevented recruitment of T.

   the germination of Aconitum japonicum seeds were studied. Both autumn
   and spring sowings, gave high germination rates when the seeds had been
   treated with gibberellin A-3. A treatment with 50 ppm gibberellin was
   effective, and treatment with 500 ppm gibberellin was more effective for
   germination. The effects of presoaking of the seeds in a 500 ppm
   gibberellin solution for 3 h and 24 h were about the same. Kinetin,
   thiourea and potassium nitrate did not have such an effect of breaking
   dormancy of the seeds. The optimum temperature for germination was 10
   degree C. At higher temperatures, the germination rate tended to be
   reduced, but the average days required for germination were shortened.
   Low temperature (5 degree C) treatments for 2 weeks, one month, 2 months
   and 3 months, and stratification for about 3 months were not so
   effective as gibberellin treatment. In the pot test started on 17,
   December the seeds pre-soaked with 500 ppm gibberellin for 24 h, gave
   50% germination rate in the spring of the 1st year, while the
   germination rate of non-treated seeds of the 1st year was 10% and then
   that of the 2nd year was 4%. Treatment with 500 ppm gibberellin A-3 at

   waterbath with an air current at up to 30°C with the aim of reducing
   germination time and avoiding chilling stress which results from cold
   outdoor sowings. The seeds were germinated at 5, 10, 15 or 20°. Both
   treatments reduced the germination times at 10° and 15° by about 3 days,
   compared with those for untreated controls. Crops of foliage from Mar.
   sown seeds treated with low doses of ionizing rays could be harvested 1
   week earlier than those from untreated seeds sown a fortnight later.
   Sowings made in Apr. and summer on irrigated soils always showed
   accelerated seedling emergence, and sometimes outyielded the control, if
   the seeds had been exposed to the waterbath treatment for 30 h. A sowing
   rate of 40 kg seed/ha gave a higher crop yield than 20 kg/ha, the
   further increase in yield obtained with 60 kg/ha was not economically
   justified. Seed treatment with a helium-neon laser (0.5 m W/cm, 632.8

AB The genus Sideritis is an indigenous plant to temperate and subtropical
   regions of Turkey, especially for Mediterranean and Aegean region, and
   is extensively used as herbal tea and spice. The seeds of Sideritis
   species have a difficulty in germination, which limits their
   cultivation. This study was conducted to evaluate the germination
   performance of 4 endemic Sideritis species (Sideritis condensata, S.
   libanotica ssp. linearis, S. leptoclada and S. tmolea) harvested freshly
   or stored for 1 and 2 years in terms of germination percentage and mean
   germination time and to determine the suitability of seed treatments
   (Hydration and gibberellic acid (GA(3)) application, and their
   combination with pre-chilling) for overcoming germination difficulty in
   the species. Germination percentages of these species ranged from 28.5%
   to 77.0%. The lowest germination rate and the highest mean germination
   time (11.9 day) were determined in S. libanotica ssp. linearis in fresh
   seeds. Improved germination and shortened mean germination time were
   achieved using 200 mg L-1 GA(3) application. Seed storage did not
   influence the germination of the Sideritis species. It was found that
   pre-chilling did not prerequisite for germination of the species. It was
   concluded that GA(3) treatment should effectively be used as a method
   for improving germination of endemic Sideritis species regardless of
   seed age.

   events occur. The objective of this research was to determine the extent
   of seed dormancy in 28 species of grasses and forbs from
   alpine-subalpine areas of the Olympic Mountains, Clallam Co.,
   Washington. Five species were non-dormant. After-ripening improved
   germination of eight species, five required cold stratification,
   scarification benefited four, and some seeds of 11 species required
   light. Four others failed to germinate at all under the given
   treatments. At least one species may have possessed more than one
   dormancy mechanism. Results from this study support recommendations for
   shallow or surface sowing of seeds to satisfy light requirements and
   fall-planting to increase the likelihood of natural scarification and
   cold stratification. The diversity and extent of dormancy mechanisms
   encountered here suggests that under harsh and uncertain alpine growing
   conditions, natural selection may favor seeds with a genetic system for
   dormancy and delayed germination. After-ripening occurred even while
   seeds were in cold-dry storage, suggesting that ecological studies
   should not use cold-stored seeds and assume they will behave as though
   they are freshly matured. Seed dormancy may control germination timing
   and rate, which in turn effect plant establishment and competitive
   ability, and ultimately population, successional, and community patterns
   of high-elevation vegetation. Successful germination protocols improve
   propagation success and aid efforts to revegetate disturbed areas in
   Olympic National Park and other high-elevation areas in the Pacific
   Northwest.

AB This study was conducted to determine some properties of the Amygdalus
   arabica Oliver almond species used as rootstocks and their production.
   The description of this species, seed germination of different 5
   species, growth of seedlings, budding success were investigated.
   The kernels of almonds are bitter. Seed width is between 8.55 - 9.26 mm,
   seed length is between 13.76 - 15.44 mm, seed suture is between 10.62 -
   11.74 mm and seed weights are between 0.60 - 0.79g.
   There is no problem with the germination of the seeds. The best
   germination rate; It was obtained as an average of 72.7% of seeds which
   were soaked in 250 ppm GA(3) solution for 2 days and applied to
   stratification for 30 days at 4 degrees C.
   Seedling growth of the Arabian almond has been thin, and Seedling has
   not reached the level of grafting for 6 months. Seedling diameter of
   almond types ranged from 2.74 to 3.97 mm, and the length of the seedling
   ranged from 18.5 to 20.0 cm.
   The budding work of A. arabica was carried out on the wild type at the
   field. Ferragnes almond variety is grafted. It seems that there is no
   problem with the grafting success. At Budding done in 3 periods, the
   best budding rate was obtained in February (50.0 - 70.0%), followed by
   the budding in September (30.0 - 40.0%) with the lowest budding rates
   from June budding (6.7 to 16.7 %).
   It has been concluded that A. arabica can be used as a rootstock in some
   stone (almond, peach, nectarine, plum, apricot) fruit species. It can
   also be used for afforestation and fruit cultivation in arid and
   semi-arid areas. These features should be evaluated by preliminary
   studies.

   damascena Mill. Seeds of R. damascena Mill. are the most used scented
   rose species in rose oil production. The most important production
   centers around the world are Turkey and Bulgaria. The seeds were
   subjected to 4 weeks of warm stratification at 25 degrees C, followed by
   150 days of cold stratification at 4 +/- 1 degrees C. Before
   stratification, 4 different microbial fertilizers, EM.1 (R), B:speel
   (TM), Bioplin (TM) and Phosfert (TM) were inoculated to the seeds. In
   the study, the microbial inoculation treatments significantly (p < 0.01)
   promoted the premature germination percentage during cold
   stratification. During the stratification, the highest premature
   germination percentage was obtained from the EM.1 (R) (69.3%). The
   highest germination percentage in terms of cumulative germination
   percentage was determined in EM.1 (R) (100.0%), followed by Phosfert
   (TM) (84.0%) and B: seepel (TM) (84.0%), whereas the lowest germination
   percentage was found in the control treatment (69.3%). The EM.1 (R)
   shortened the mean germination time by 1.7 days in comparison to the
   control. In conclusion, it was observed that with microbial inoculation
   (particularly EM.1 (R)) to oil rose seeds and a stratification time of
   150 days, dormancy was broken and germination highly improved.

AB Experiments were carried out to study the germination biology and virus
   susceptibility of wild cucumber (Echinocystis lobata Torr. et Gray). The
   freshly harvested seeds had strong primary dormancy, because in spite of
   the high seed viability (87%) they did not germinate at all. Seed
   dormancy was broken when the seeds were stored at 6 degrees C in moist
   sand and considerable percentage of the seeds germinated during
   stratification. The seeds seemed to germinate better after storing at
   -18 degrees C under dry conditions as compared to freshly harvested
   ones. Seeds derived from ripened (brown) capsules germinated better than
   those derived from unripened (green) ones. The germination rate was
   enhanced by 50% by removing the seed coat in the case of seeds obtained
   from ripened capsules. The germination rate was not influenced
   significantly when the seed coat was removed in the case of seeds
   obtained from unripened capsules. An aqueous extract of the seed coat of
   wild cucumber retarded the germination and early development of cress
   (Lepidium sativum) and significantly reduced (by 10%) the germination of
   rape.
   Among the 19 viruses, cucumber mosaic cucumovirus caused systemic mosaic
   symptoms, leaf deformation and vein clearing on wild cucumber leaves. A
   systemic latent relation was observed between wild cucumber and the
   potato X potexvirus. Wild cucumber was resistant to the remaining 17
   viruses.

   The fresh seeds (non-stratified) of A. cyclophyllon had 55% germination.
   Analysis of variance indicated that both GA(3) and H2SO4 concentrations
   had significant effects on seed germination and final germination
   percentage. The highest germination percentage (81%) was obtained when
   the seeds were treated with 500 ppm GA(3). The results showed that hot

AB Carex is a globally distributed genus with more than 2000 species
   worldwide and Carex species are the characteristic vegetation of sedge
   meadow wetlands. In the mid-continental United States, Carex species are
   dominant in natural freshwater wetlands yet are slow to recolonize
   hydrologically restored wetlands. To aid in Carex revegetation efforts,
   we determined the dormancy breaking and temperature germination
   requirements of 12 Carex species. Seeds were cold stratified at 5/1
   degrees C for 0-6 months and then incubated in light at 5/1 degrees C,
   14/1 degrees C, 22/8 degrees C, 27/15 degrees C, or 35/30 degrees C. We
   found that all Carex species produced conditionally dormant seeds. The
   optimal temperature for germination for all but three species was 27/15
   degrees C. As is the case in other species with physiological dormancy,
   cold stratification increased germination percentages, broadened the
   temperature range suitable for germination, and increased germination
   rates for most species, but the magnitude of the effects varied among
   species. Many species germinated to 80% at 27/15 degrees C without cold
   stratification and at 22/8 degrees C with <= 1 month of stratification
   but required much longer stratification (up to 6 months depending on the
   species) to germinate to 80% at 14/1 degrees C and 35/30 degrees C. Our
   findings illustrate how a stratification pretreatment can greatly
   benefit Carex seed sowing efforts by triggering rapid germination to
   higher percentages. We recommend that cold stratification be targeted
   towards species with strong dormancy or used across a wider range of
   species when seed supplies for restoration are limiting. For Carex
   revegetation, establishing Carex canopies rapidly may help to prevent
   the invasion of undesirable species such as Phalaris arundinacea.

AB The germination rate of angelica seeds from wild type populations
   (Retezat Mountains) and cultivated plants (experimental field) was
   studied after different storage duration in different germination
   conditions in continuous light or in darkness, after stratification at
   low temperature and on different substrates (alluvial soil, wetted
   filter paper, concentrated and diluted soil extracts, or distilled
   water). The results show marked differences in the germination rate of
   seeds from wild plants as compared with those harvested from cultivated
   plants after increasing storage duration. The germination rate of the
   seeds from cultivated plants decreased rapidly after harvesting, whereas
   that of the seeds from wild plants increased with storage duration up to
   about 80% after 5 months. Elder seeds lost their germination after more
   than one year of storage. Continuous light is necessary to ensure high
   germination rates. Seeds kept in the dark or in the soil did not
   germinated or germinate very slow only to a few percent. A cold
   pretreatment of moist seeds (2 weeks, 4°C) had, generally, a promoting
   effect on germination, but during a relative short time after harvesting
   (5 month), seed germination was also high after exposing moist seeds at
   room temperature for 2 weeks under continuous light. The nature of the
   substrate had no noticeable effects on the germination rate, if the
   seeds were exposed to continuous light. Thus, light seems to be the main
   factor for the induction of seed germination in Angelica archangelica.

   Rafsanjan, including Markazi, Anar, Koshkoiyeh and Nogh. Dormancy
   breaking treatments for P. farcta included scarification by scalpel and
   sandpaper, chemical scarification by sulfuric acid (30 and 40 min), and
   distilled water as control. Treatments for L. acanthodes included
   gibberellic acid (250, 500 and 1000 ppm), KNO3 (500 and 1000 ppm), cold
   stratification (for 1, 3 and 5 weeks). Treatments for C. cretica
   included scarification by scalpel and sandpaper, sulfuric acid (5 and 10
   minute), boiling water (for 15 and 30 min) and distilled water as
   control. Results showed that seed germination percentage (SGP) and mean
   germination time (MGT) was significantly different among different weed
   populations and dormancy breaking methods. Seed scarification by scalpel
   and sulfuric acid resulted in highest SGP in P. farcta and C. cretica.
   For all L. acanthodes populations, cold stratification for 5 weeks
   increased SGP, especially in Anar (94%). Using KNO3 at 500 ppm, and 250
   ppm gibberellic acid, significantly increased germination percentage of
   L. acanthodes seeds (79 and 74.8%, respectively), but higher
   concentration of KNO3 and gibberellic acid, reduced germination
   percentage.

AB Production of eldarica pine (Pinus brutia var. eldarica) seedlings for
   Christmas tree or ornamental use could be improved by more rapid
   germination. Seeds of this species exhibit shallow dormancy and
   generally do not require stratification. However, osmotic priming may
   speed emergence. Seeds of eldarica pine were preconditioned at room
   temperature in an aerated solution of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 for
   2, 5, 7, 9, and 11 days, at one of 3 concentrations (200, 300, and 400 g
   PEG/kg water). After treatment, seeds were sown in plastic trays and
   grown in a greenhouse for 12 weeks. PEG reduced germination by 7 to 15
   percentage points. However, speed of germination measured as days to 50%
   germination (T50) was reduced 4 days by treatments of up to 9 days'
   duration. Because of the more rapid germination, shoot length and shoot
   dry weight measured 12 weeks after sowing were increased by priming.
   Concentrations of 200 or 300 g PEG/kg water for 9 days provided the best
   response. Although osmotic priming increased speed of germination and
   subsequent seedling size, other invigoration treatments such as
   stratification or controlled hydration may offer greater benefits in
   nursery production at lower cost.

   3.3 d in pepper and improvement in emergence from 10 % in sugar beet to
   30 % in table beet. Further improvement in emergence occurred by
   inclusion of pesticides and/or gibberellin during conditioning. A 4 d
   conditioning of pepper at 25 degrees C was superior to 7 d conditioning
   at 15 degrees C in seeds germinated at 15 degrees C on filter paper, but
   15 degrees C conditioning was superior in improving percentage emergence
   in early field plantings. Tomato seeds conditioned at 15 or 25 degrees C
   performed equally well in the field. A 2 d conditioning was superior to
   1 d conditioning in improving the performance of supersweet sweet corn
   cultivars grown in a growth chamber at 10/20 degrees C. The water uptake
   rate in the presence of Micro-Gel E during matriconditioning of sweet
   corn seeds was slower than when the seeds were exposed to the same
   amount of water in absence of the carrier. Electrolyte leakage was
   greater in supersweet 'Challenger' sweet corn seeds carrying the sh,
   gene compared to the sugary type sweet corn 'More', and in both cases
   matriconditioning reduced the leakage. Lettuce seeds matriconditioned
   for 24 h had higher 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) content,
   developed greater ACC oxidase activity and performed better at 10
   degrees C (germinated earlier and had higher percentage germination)
   than the untreated seeds. Matriconditioning appears to bring about
   beneficial physical, physiological and biochemical changes that
   seemingly improve embryo growth potential and tolerance to low
   temperatures.

AB Polyamines are low molecular weight organic compounds involved in
   diverse range of biological processes in all living organisms. Seed
   priming is a technique that improves seed performance by rapid and
   uniform germination with normal and vigorous seedlings. A laboratory
   study was performed to explore the benefits of seed priming with
   polyamines on seed germination and seedling growth of hot pepper
   (Capsicum annuum L.) Hot pepper seeds were primed in aerated solution of
   putrescine, spermine, or spermidine (25, 50, 75, and 100 mM) for 48 h at
   25 +/- 2 degrees C. Significant results (P < 0.05) were observed for
   different attributes of seed germination and early seedling growth.
   Polyamines priming resulted in earlier and synchronized germination via
   improving final germination percentage, time to 50% germination, mean
   germination time, germination energy, germination speed and germination
   index compared with control. Improvement in shoot and root length,
   seedling fresh and dry weight, seedling growth rate and seedling vigor
   index was clearly indicative of positive effects of seed priming with
   polyamines. Out of all polyamines, putrescine proved to be better at low
   concentrations (i.e. 25 and 50 mM) for most of the traits related to

AB This study was conducted to explore the potential of pre-sowing chilling
   treatments to improve the germination, seedling emergence, early
   seedling growth, electrolyte leakage and ion uptake in wheat seedlings.
   The wheat seeds were incubated at -19 degrees C for 24, 48 and 96 h;
   untreated dry seeds were taken as control. Chilling treatment for 96 h
   reduced the mean germination time (MGT), mean emergence time (MET) and
   increased FGP compared with control and chilling for 24 h. GI, EI and
   FEP were not significantly affected by chilling treatments. Chilling
   treatment with 24 and 96 h increased the plumule length, root length,
   shoot length, number of secondary roots, root dry weight and shoot dry
   weight as compared with control. Regarding biochemical attributes,
   seedling potassium contents were decreased while total soluble sugars
   were increased in wheat seedlings by chilling treatments particularly by
   chilling for 96 h. Phosphorous contents in the wheat seedling remained
   unaffected by chilling treatments. Chilling for 96 h showed maximum
   electrical conductivity than other treatments including control at 1, 2,
   6 and 12 h after imbibition. While, minimum electrical conductivity of
   seed leachates was recorded in 24 h chilling. Pre-sowing chilling
   treatment for 24 h may be opted for wheat seed invigoration.

AB Fennel is one of the most important medicinal and spice plants and has
   become one of the most important economical medicinal plants in
   Mediterranean, and the Middle East. The germination ability and
   percentage are fundamental characteristics which influence the viability
   of the plants. Prechilling has meaningful influence on coleoptile
   length, radicle length, seedling length, germination percentage, mean
   time for germination and germination rate, but uniformity of seed
   germination did not significantly influenced by it. The cultivar effect
   was significant on coleoptile length, radicle length, seedling length,
   germination percentage and germination rate. However, mean time for
   germination and uniformity of seed germination did not significantly
   affected by cultivar. All experimental characteristics, except
   uniformity of seed germination, significantly influenced by hormone. The
   maximum coleoptile length, radicle length, seedling length, germination
   percentage and germination ratio was related to 45 days moist
   prechilling treatment. Isfahan cultivar also had obtained the highest
   coleoptile and radicle length, seedling length, germination percentage
   and germination ratio compare to Shiraz cultivar. It seems that
   application of endogenous GA3+KI and BA+KI concentration, which is
   provided mostly by chilling treatment, is the most effective factor for
   breaking the seed dormancy. On the basis of the results, usage of 45
   days moist prechilling accompanied with application of GA3+KI and BA+KI
   in Isfahan cultivar was appropriate.

AB A healthy crop is desirable in direct seeded vegetables to ensure good
   quality of the produce and is affected by a number of environmental and
   cultural factors. A number of seed treatments had been used to enhance
   the performance of seeds in several crops. Alternate cycles of dry heat
   and chilling (thermal hardening) is one of these seed treatments, used
   in cereals to invigorate the seeds, but reports about such treatments in
   vegetable crops are scarce. Therefore, seeds of cabbage varieties Golden
   Acre (GA) and Green Ball (GB), varying in their germination (%) and
   vigour, were exposed to different temperature (-20 and 40°C) and
   duration (24, 36 and 48 hrs) regimes and the effect of these treatments
   on seed vigour was evaluated. Different thermal hardening treatments,
   especially H-C 24 hrs, C-H 36 hrs, C-H-C 24 hrs and C-H-C 48 hrs,
   increased final germination percentage (FGP), power of germination and
   seedling vigour. These treatments decreased the germination spread over
   time in cabbage variety GB. However, such response was not observed in
   GA that already had high seed vigour. The impact of these better
   performing treatments was evaluated on germination and vigour of GA
   seeds under saline conditions. Interestingly, mean germination time and
   time taken for 50% germination was less for C-H 36 hrs and C-H-C 24 hrs
   treated seeds at all salinity levels. These seed treatments (H-C 24 hrs,
   C-H 36 hrs, C-H-C 24 hrs and C-H-C 48 hrs) improved vigour index at all
   salinity levels except at 200 mM NaCl concentration. Overall results
   depicted that C-H 36 hrs and C-H-C 24 hrs were more effective than other
   treatments to impart salinity tolerance and can be used as a safe tool
   for direct seeding of cabbage crop under normal and saline conditions.

AB Introduction: Drought stress is one of the major problems in sugar beet
   production in Iran, and is the most important limiting factor for
   germination and establishment of sugar beet in the early stages of
   growth. Seed priming with chemical, nutrient elements or pre-chilling
   techniques are the most effective methods to improve germination
   percentage and speed, leading to uniform and tolerant seedlings in
   adverse environmental conditions. Material and Methods: In order to
   assess the effect of cold stratification and HCl treatments on the
   germination of sugar beet seed, cv. Ekbatan, under drought stress
   conditions, a RCBD factorial experiment with three replications was
   conducted in Seed Science and Technology Lab of Shahrekord University.
   The first factor was stratification in two levels; the second factor was
   seven levels of pretreatments including 2, 4 and 6 hours' soaking in
   water and 0.03 HCL accompanied with control, and the third factor was
   four drought levels (control, -2, -4, -6 bar). Result: Compared with the
   control, seed germination percentage and germination rate increased by
   at least 5-fold, relative germination by 50% and root and shoot length
   by 10%, due to stratification and duration of exposure to HCl
   treatments. With no stratification, germination traits increased with
   increases in exposure time in acid, and the highest values were obtained
   for the seeds exposed to HCl 0.03 normal for 6 hours. Although under
   optimal conditions, the effect of HCl was compensated for by
   stratification, in drought conditions, the highest values were observed
   in stratified seeds and those placed in acid. Conclusions: Since
   successful establishment of sugar beet seedlings at drought stress
   conditions is critical to achieving optimum density and yield,
   application of stratification treatments for one week and seed exposure
   to HCl increased the seed performance under stress conditions. This
   trend continued to increase with drought stress intensity, and placement
   of seeds in acid doubled seed germination in -2 bar drought conditions,
   which continued by 4 times in -6 bar, compared with stratified control
   seeds. Compared to separate application of the treatments, application
   of stratification and HCl treatments had synergistic effects on sugar
   beet seed performance, especially under drought stress conditions.

AB The seeds of Prunus yedoensis have slow and poor germination when intact
   (with endocarp). Cold and/or warm stratification, washing, and
   scarification with liquid nitrogen and sulfuric acid, in combination
   with or without gibberellic acid (GA(3)) application, were investigated
   as facilitators for rapid and high germination. No germination was
   observed without GA(3) in any treatment for intact seeds. GA(3)
   treatment for one day significantly shortens the mean germination time
   (MGT) and improves seed germination percentage. Immersion in liquid
   nitrogen followed by GA(3) treatment, GA(3) application to intact seeds
   and seed coat removed seeds significantly enhanced the germination and
   MGT to 63 +/- 7.6% (8.6 weeks), 71 +/- 5.0% (4.7 weeks), and 93 +/- 5.1%
   (0.8 weeks), compared to untreated seeds or stratified seeds (0%)
   chilled for six months. Depending on the GA(3) application method,
   results could be different in intact seeds. GA(3) application with
   vigorous shaking accomplished higher germination and lower MGT (71 +/-
   5.0%, 4.7 weeks) than gentle shaking incubation (33 +/- 6.0%, 10.4
   weeks). The germination inhibitor(s) were located in the seed coat
   because seed coat extract inhibited germination in decoated seeds.
   Therefore, coat removal alleviates the inability to promote germination
   and it has the same beneficial effect as does the application of GA(3) .
   According to the results, it suggest that the effective application of
   GA(3) on intact seeds or seed coat removal could overcome seed dormancy
   in P. yedoensis.

AB Abstract - This research was conducted to develop a seed propagation
   protocol for the use of Broussonetia kazinoki Siebold ex Siebold & Zucc,
   which native to East Asia. Light and temperature conditions, GA3
   treatment, and low-temperature stratification were performed to evaluate
   the germination characteristics. The germination percentage at 4, 15/6,
   20/10 and 25/15℃ was 0, 42. 5, 44. 4 and 91.7%, respectively. Thus, the
   optimal germination temperature of the B. kazinoki seeds was 25/15℃.
   Although germination was delayed by relatively low temperature
   conditions, GA3 treatment allowed for increased germination rates even
   under the low temperature conditions. Cold stratification reduced time
   to germination. Relatively low germination percentages at 20/10℃ and
   15/6℃ indicated that the seeds had been under the state of conditional
   dormancy. Through this study, B. kazinoki seeds have conditional
   dormancy because they can be germinated through GA3 treatment even under
   relatively low temperature conditions and it is judged that it will
   support the commercial propagation practice in the future.

   (stratification). To break dormancy, seeds of SETGL, SETVI and SETFA
   needed to be stored under the above conditions for at least 2, 4 and 4-5
   months, resp. After dormancy breaking, seeds were transferred to low
   temperature (4°C) under dry conditions. SETGL showed a germination rate
   of 96% even after 2 months of storage. SETVI and SETFA showed a
   decreased germination rate (54 and 69%, resp.) and a lower speed of
   germination, indicating that secondary dormancy might have been induced.
   However, a significant change in germination rate was not observed when
   seeds were transferred to dry conditions at room temperature (25°C). The
   viability of SETGL seed began to decline from the 6th year after storage
   under dry conditions at room temperature. All 3 species showed a
   relatively high germination rate at 30/20°C (14/10 h) and germination
   rate was not increased by light. All 3 species exhibited similar
   responses to cycloxydim, sethoxydim and primisulfuron in a greenhouse
   experiment. In contrast, SETVI and SETFA were relatively susceptible to
   fenoxaprop-ethyl, SETFA to fluazifop-butyl, SETGL and SETFA to
   chlorimuron-ethyl, and SETGL to EK-2612. The difference in herbicidal
   response among the 3 species was highest for EK-2612. These results
   suggest that these 3 species do not respond in the same way to these
   herbicides which have the same target site. No relationship was found
   between germination characteristics and response to herbicides.

AB Background: Domestication and improvement processes, accompanied by
   selections and adaptations, have generated genome-wide divergence and
   stratification in soybean populations. Simultaneously, soybean
   populations, which comprise diverse subpopulations, have developed their
   own adaptive characteristics enhancing fitness, resistance, agronomic
   traits, and morphological features. The genetic traits underlying these
   characteristics play a fundamental role in improving other soybean
   populations. Results: This study focused on identifying the selection
   signatures and adaptive characteristics in soybean populations. A core
   set of 245 accessions (112 wild-type, 79 landrace, and 54 improvement
   soybeans) selected from 4,234 soybean accessions was re-sequenced. Their
   genomic architectures were examined according to the domestication and
   improvement, and accessions were then classified into 3 wild-type, 2
   landrace, and 2 improvement subgroups based on various population
   analyses. Selection and gene set enrichment analyses revealed that the
   landrace subgroups have selection signals for soybean-cyst nematode HG
   type 0 and seed development with germination, and that the improvement
   subgroups have selection signals for plant development with viability
   and seed development with embryo development, respectively. The adaptive
   characteristic for soybean-cyst nematode was partially underpinned by
   multiple resistance accessions, and the characteristics related to seed
   development were supported by our phenotypic findings for seed weights.
   Furthermore, their adaptive characteristics were also confirmed as
   genome-based evidence, and unique genomic regions that exhibit distinct
   selection and selective sweep patterns were revealed for 13 candidate
   genes. Conclusions: Although our findings require further biological
   validation, they provide valuable information about soybean breeding
   strategies and present new options for breeders seeking donor lines to
   improve soybean populations.

AB P. dichotomiflorum was subjected to a number of different treatments,

   characteristics of seedling emergence and growth. Seeds were also
   pretreated with low-temperature (4°C) stratification to break dormancy,
   and were germinated under different temperature regimes and water
   potentials. The germination rate of P. dichotomiflorum was increased
   from 0% of dormant seeds to 1, 35 and 44% by stratification for 21, 28
   and 42 days, respectively. Two dominant weed species in direct-sown rice
   fields, Echinochloa crus-galli and P. dichotomiflorum, showed different
   germination characteristics under different temperature regimes: the
   former exhibited a higher germination rate than the latter in a
   relatively low temperature regime (20/10°C). Both species germinated
   faster at 30/20°C than at 20/10°C. When the water potential was lowered,
   germination of P. dichotomiflorum was reduced more drastically than was
   that of E. crus-galli. The critical water potential for germination of
   P. dichotomiflorum was -0.7 MPa but E. crus-galli was affected slightly
   by the same water potential. These results demonstrate that E.
   crus-galli can germinate under a wider range of soil water potentials
   than can P. dichotomiflorum. Emergence of P. dichotomiflorum was highly
   affected by irrigation depth and the level of the water table. The
   maximum depth of irrigation water for the survival of P. dichotomiflorum
   seedlings was 9 cm.

AB This study was conducted to reveal the effective germination method of

   temperatures, and seed collection times. The obtained results are shown
   below; The rate of spilt achene pericarp was analyzed for 6 storage
   methods; i. e, dry and moist room temperature storage, dry and moist
   cold storage, moist storage and cold stratification storage until 12
   weeks after sowing. The moist storage method showed the most excellent
   value (82%) in the rate of split achene pericarp over all storage
   methods. But, non-split achene pericarp occurred when the seeds were
   stored either dry room temperature or at 4degreeC without providing any
   moisture up to 12 weeks after sowing. Germination rate was peak (80%)
   when treated with 1,000mg/l GA3 after gradual exposure to the
   temperature ranging from 4degreeC to 25degreeC with moisture. When the
   seeds were stored at 4degreeC with moisture and cold stratification
   storage, the germination rates resulted in 78%, 76% respectively.
   However, only 41% of the seeds germinated when they were stored at room
   temperature with moisture. No seed germination occurred when the seeds
   were stored either dry room temperature or at 4degreeC without providing
   any moisture up to 10 weeks after sowing. The effect of temperature on
   seed germination was also analyzed. When the seeds were cultured at
   20degreeC until 5 weeks, 78% of them was germinated. However, as the
   temperature got either lower or higher than 20degreeC, the germination
   rate decreased. When the seeds were cultured at the temperatures
   25degreeC, 15degreeC, 10degreeC and 5degreeC until 5 weeks, the
   germination rates were 64%, 69%, 60% and 52%, respectively. The seed
   collection time also appeared to influence the germination rate. When
   the seeds were collected on October 10 and 20, the germination rates
   were 78 and 80%, respectively. However, the germination rate of seeds
   collected earlier than that period decreased dramatically.

AB Seed germination is an important stage in the lifecycle of a plant
   because it determines subsequent vegetative growth and reproduction.
   Here, we show that the E3 SUMO ligase AtSIZ1 regulates seed dormancy and
   germination. The germination rates of the siz1 mutants were less than
   50%, even after a short period of ripening. However, their germination
   rates increased to wild-type levels after cold stratification or long
   periods of ripening. In addition, exogenous gibberellin (GA) application
   improved the germination rates of the siz1 mutants to the wild-type
   level. In transgenic plants, suppression of AtSIZ1 caused rapid
   post-translational decay of SLEEPY1 (SLY1), a positive regulator of GA
   signaling, during germination, and inducible AtSIZ1 overexpression led
   to increased SLY1 levels. In addition, overexpressing wild-type SLY1 in
   transgenic sly1 mutants increased their germination ratios to wild-type
   levels, whereas the germination ratio of transgenic sly1 mutants
   overexpressing mSLY1 was similar to that of sly1. The germination ratios
   of siz1 mutant seeds in immature developing siliques were much lower
   than those of the wild-type. Moreover, SLY1 and DELAY OF GERMINATION 1
   (DOG1) transcript levels were reduced in the siz1 mutants, whereas the
   transcript levels of DELLA and ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI3) were
   higher than those of the wild-type. Taken together, these results
   indicate that the reduced germination of the siz1 mutants results from
   impaired GA signaling due to low SLY1 levels and activity, as well as
   hyperdormancy due to high levels of expression of dormancy-related genes
   including DOG1.

AB Ginseng (Panax ginseng Meyer) is an important oriental plant that has
   been used for medicinal purposes for centuries. Propagation of ginseng
   is frequently problematic due to its prolonged seed germination time. In
   this study tested the seasonal regulation of endogenous hormones (GAs
   and ABA) and hormone treatments in order to reduce the duration of the
   seed germination period. The embryo growth ratio increased from 10.2 to
   33.7% between July 30, 2009 to October 27, 2009 and abruptly increased
   to 71.6% of the that. The seed germination rate assessed for different
   seed sizes revealed that approximately 60.2%-63.0% of the seeds had
   germinated by April 20, 2010; however, no significant differences in
   germination rate were observed among the different seed sizes. Analysis
   of GA showed that endogenous GAs were synthesized in the ginseng seeds
   through a non-13-hydroxylation pathway and the early 13-hydroxylation
   pathway. The GA contents were significantly increased from December 2009
   to February 2010, while endogenous ABA contents were significantly
   reduced. However, the GA contents from August 2009 to December 2009 were
   lower than or comparable to the ABA contents, which were significantly
   increased. Thus, the total concentration of GAs and ABA during different
   seed growth stages suggests antagonism between these hormones.
   Similarly, the embryo growth ratio during the seed collection period
   revealed a similar trend in which the total GA and ABA contents were
   inversely related.

   Soc. 139: 76-85. 2012-.Cyperus entrerianus (Boeckler) (deeprooted sedge,
   deeproot sedge, woodrush flatsedge) has become naturalized throughout
   the Texas coastal prairie ecoregion and is now found throughout much of
   the southeastern United States. Originally from Argentina, its
   successful naturalization is linked to its rapid growth, morphological
   plasticity, and generalized habitat requirements, but little work has
   focused upon its seed biology or ecology. Research was conducted to
   quantify phytomorphological variability, develop seed yield prediction
   models, and quantify germination requirements for C. entrerianus to aid
   in future control and management efforts of this exotic invasive sedge,
   particularly those focused upon seedbanks. Cyperus entrerianus
   phytomorphology, seed production, and seed germination were extremely
   variable among study areas, and provide evidence for its successful
   naturalization. Although plants varied morphologically, spike cluster
   area and inflorescence diameter explained much of the variation in seed
   biomass production. Seed yield prediction models will be useful in
   monitoring seed production throughout its naturalized range. We
   estimated that 1300-3100 kg ha(-1) seeds could be produced in monotypic
   stands, although germination rates varied among study areas as well.
   Seeds collected from larger plants in sites that produced more seeds
   showed germination rates > 85%. Seeds exposed to imbibition and chilling
   treatments had reduced germination, although no seed treatments
   (imbibition, chilling, combinations thereof) depressed germination rates
   below 63%. Immediate and short-term control and management efforts
   should focus upon interruption of seed production, via aboveground plant
   removal, but long-term efforts must target seedbank management. Although
   seed longevity is not known, seedbank depletion and subsequent
   integrated management using herbicides and prescribed fire will be
   required for local and large scale control efforts.

AB Linum olympicum Boiss. (Linaceae) is an endemic species to Turkey, and
   has both medicinal and ornamental properties. In this study, we
   investigated the effects of GA(3) and cold stratification (1 or 4months)
   on the germination and mean germination time in relation to breaking
   dormancy in this species under darkness (20 degrees C) and light (20/10
   degrees C, 12/12h) conditions. Seeds were collected from specimens that
   spread on limestone or granite screes, ledges of rocky or turfy slopes,
   and hilltops of the alpine belt from Uluda Mt. (Bursa, Turkey,
   2200-2300m). We show that a combination of hormone and cold
   stratification treatments promoted seed germination under darkness and
   light conditions. Non-stratified seeds germinated to 73% following
   1000mgL(-1) GA(3) treatment and also it was 83% after 1month cold
   stratification. After 4months of cold stratification treatment, 10% and
   53.3% of seeds successfully germinated after incubation in light and
   dark conditions, respectively. Hormone and cold stratification
   treatments also reduced mean germination time. Our results revealed that
   seeds of L. olympicum have physiological dormancy and require prolonged
   time for cold stratification and darkness for germination, rather than
   responding to the photoperiod. Germination requirements of L. olympicum
   have not been studied previously, and the data obtained could be used
   for the ex situ protection of this alpine species.

   investigated. Germination was studied for fresh seeds, for seeds
   subjected to short-time chilling (15 days, moist +4 degrees C), to GA(3)
   (100, 150 and 250 ppm) and a combination of chilling and GA(3); in all
   cases seeds were incubated either at 20/10 degrees C day/night with
   light daytime or at 20 degrees C in darkness with daily short-time dim
   light (DSDL). In C. leucopsis seeds, all GA(3) treatments enhanced the
   final germination percentages. The mean germination time (MGT) of C.
   leucopsis was lower under DSDL than with photoperiod. The chilling
   treatment with GA(3) in DSDL significantly increased germination in S.
   olympicus seeds (from 45 to 87%). Germination increased to 55% in T.
   pichleri by chilling under photoperiod compared with 32% by chilling
   followed by DSDL. In conclusion, these three co-existing endemic
   Asteraceae species have different germination behaviours; something that
   should be taken into account for ex situ propagation. However, an
   efficient way to germinate all species is to use 250 ppm GA(3) and 20/10

   hormone and moist chilling treatments under dark (20 degrees C) and
   photoperiod (20/10 degrees C; 12/12 h, respectively) conditions. GA(3)
   was able to break dormancy. The highest germination rate was found in
   the seeds treated with 250 ppm GA(3); 64% of these seeds germinated when
   treated with moist chilling and incubated in the dark, while 75%
   germinated under photoperiod conditions. Moreover, mean germination
   times were significantly lower in the seeds treated with 250 ppm GA(3).
   Significant differences in final germination percentages and mean
   germination times were found only for treatments under photoperiod
   conditions. Scarification also permitted germination; the highest
   germination rate (78%) was found with 15 min of scarification. Dormancy
   was not broken by moist chilling for up to 90 days. The germination
   requirements of dormant P. olympica seeds are found to be consistent
   with characteristics of its habitat. This can be considered an
   ecological advantage for the species establishment and persistence.

   Acer ginnala, introduced but not invasive tree in the Middle Urals. The
   period of stratification in the air modeled by collecting seeds in
   October and December. The duration of cold stratification under the snow
   was 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 months. We hypothesized that the duration of
   stratification in the air did not affect the germination of A. negundo
   and A. ginnala seeds. Cold stratification under the snow had a positive
   effect on seed germination of both species. The best seed germination of
   A. negundo and A. ginnala was after 4 months of cold stratification
   under the snow, the germination rate differs: in A. negundo 12 4% (small
   seeds) and 79 7% (large seeds), in A. ginnala 1 2% (small seeds) and 18
   4% (large seeds). In both species, large seeds germinated at 7 to 18
   times more intensively than small ones. In A. ginnala case, even after
   cold stratification under snow for 4 months, no more than 22% of the
   seeds germinated. The germination of A. ginnala seeds was 4-5 times
   lower than that of A. negundo seeds.

AB The effect of drying rates was investigated on the quality of Thai
   hot-chili (Capsicum annuum L. cv Maeping) seeds that were primed using
   2% KNO 3 solution at 20°C for 72 hr followed by eight drying treatments:
   (1) rapid drying (RD) by drying primed seeds at 35% relative humidity
   (RH) for 72 hr, (2-7) slow drying (SD) by drying primed seeds at 75% RH
   for 12 hr, 24 hr, 36 hr, 48 hr, 60 hr or 72 hr, respectively, followed
   by RD treatment as previously described and (8) double slow drying (DSD)
   by drying primed seeds at 75% RH for 48 hr followed by 50% RH for 48 hr
   and then RD. The seed quality was assessed based on a germination test,
   an emergence test, a controlled deterioration (CD) test and headspace
   ethanol assay. The results showed that all drying treatments
   significantly improved the germination rate and emergence performance of
   primed seed compared to the control. SD ≥ 48 hr and DSD outperformed RD
   for all seed quality determined. On the contrary, the germination rate
   and field emergence performance of SD ≥ 48 hr and the DSD treatments
   decreased significantly after the CD test. The negative effect of these
   slow-drying treatments on seed vigor was confirmed by their significant
   increases in headspace ethanol production after CD testing compared to
   RD. The optimum drying treatment is to dry the primed seed at 75% RH and
   20°C for 12 hr, followed by rapid drying at 35% RH and 20°C for 3 d.

AB Observations made in the Nikitskii-Botanical Garden (Crimea) have shown
   that plants grown from seed bore fruit in the 13th to 16th, and grafted
   plants in the 3rd to 5th year. The seeds germinated without
   stratification, and retained their high germination rate for 10-11
   months. Sprouting of seeds lasted 11-34 days. Each seed contained an
   average of 2.8 embryos. Orange seeds often produced albinos. When albino
   seedlings were grafted on a normal stock, their albinism disappeared.
   Oranges did not have a uniform dormant period, shoots started to grow in
   spring, summer, and fall. The duration of winter dormancy depended on
   the weather conditions. Orange fruit buds developed on branches of the
   3rd, 4th, and higher orders. The differentiation of flower buds began at
   the resumption of growth. As a rule, flower-bearing shoots developed on
   the tips of brances and in the axils of leaves of parts which grew in
   the past and current year. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Courtesy NSF (PL 83-480)

AB In semi-natural grasslands, mowing leads to the dispersal of species
   that have viable seeds at the right time. For invasive plant species in
   grasslands, dispersal by mowing should be avoided, and information on
   the effect of cutting date on the germination of invasive specks is
   needed. We investigated the germination of seeds of the invasive legume
   Lupinus polyphyllus Lind!. depending on the cutting date. We measured
   seed traits associated with successful germination that can be assessed
   by managers for an improved timing of control measures. To this end, we
   sampled seeds of L polyphyllus on six cutting dates and analyzed the
   germination of these seeds in climate chambers and under ambient weather
   conditions. We collected information on seed morphology
   (color/size/hardseededness) for each cutting date to identify seed
   traits associated with successful germination. Observed germination
   patterns were highly asynchronous and differed between seeds cut at
   different dates. Seeds cut early, being green and soft, tended to
   germinate in autumn. Seeds cut late, being dark and hard, were more
   prone to germinate the following spring, after winter stratification.
   This allows the species to utilize germination niches throughout the
   year, thus indicating a bet-hedging strategy. Seed color and the
   percentage of hard seeds were good predictors of germination percentage,
   but not of mean germination time and synchrony. Managers should prevent
   the species producing black and hard seeds, while cutting plants
   carrying green and soft seeds is less problematic. Furthermore,
   germination patterns differed between climate chambers and the common
   garden, mainly because germination of dormant seeds was lower in climate
   chambers. More germination experiments under ambient weather conditions
   should be carried out, as they can give information on the germination
   dynamics of invasive species.

AB The coastline of South Africa is characterized by extensive dune fields
   which are threatened by development, and thus the demand of
   stabilization of drift sand will increase. The non-invasive alien grass
   species Ammophila arenaria is at present the dominant sand stabilizer.
   Due to its foreign origin and invasiveness in North America its use was
   criticized and indigenous sand-binding species would be preferred. The
   germination requirements of the native Arctotheca populifolia, Ipomoea
   pes-caprae, Myrica cordifolia and Scaevola plumieri were investigated.
   The results showed that for all four species the total germination time
   and germination phase could be shortened and germination success (number
   of germinated seeds) improved. The different scarification and
   stratification treatments broke the dormancy of I. pes-caprae, M.
   cordifolia and S. plumieri, whereas the seeds of A. populifolia were not
   dormant. Seeds of I. pes-caprae and M. cordifolia had induced an innate
   dormancy, respectively, whereas the type of dormancy in seeds of S.
   plumieri dormancy processes remained unknown.

   biggest influence on the germination of Agrostis stolonifera (Penn G-2
   and Providence), Poa supina Supranova, and Poa pratensis (Julius and
   Julius PreGerm). Higher germination rate was observed in light than in
   under dark. There were no essential variations between P. pratensis
   (Cocktail and Cocktail Headstart) and P. annua under dark and the light.
   Stratification and light greatly influenced A. capilaris and A.
   stolonifera, while P. annua was influenced by light and the medium used.
   Stratification significantly affected the germination of A. capillaris
   Bardot but not A. stolonifera Providence, P. pratensis Cocktail,
   Cocktail Headstart and Julius, and P. annua. A. capillaris Bardot was
   adversely affected by stratification in the dark, but minimally affected
   in light. Poa supina Supranova was not significantly affected with
   stratification. Nitrogen nutrition showed positive effects on all
   variants, which can be explained by the presence of gap detection
   mechanism. Germination of variants in the dark and with stratification
   was positively affected when combined with water and potassium nitrate.
   The addition of potassium nitrate positively affected also the energy of
   germination. Lack of water affected the germination of caryopsis and
   germination energy. The addition of PEG gave the same or even higher
   germination quality as the addition of water.

   having not germinated until the 25th day under constant temperature
   conditions of 10 degree C were transferred to two germinators with
   constant temperatures at 20 degree C and 30 degree C: the latter
   condition was more effective in breaking the dormancy. 3. Light
   increased the germinating ratio significantly both under the constant

   germination rate than spring sowing, and the difference was more
   emphasized in the dark. 5. Low temperature (5 degree C) treatment for
   over 12 days or stratification for over one month increased the
   germination rate, which also shortened the mean days required for
   germination.

AB Laboratory and greenhouse experiments were conducted to determine the
   effect of environmental factors on the germination and emergence of five
   species of Potentilla L. All of the species we studied differed in their
   germination requirements, and these could be related to their
   habitat/ecology. For all species, completion of germination was the
   highest at 25/15 degrees C with a 14 h photoperiod. Seeds of Potentilla
   argentea L. and P. inclinata Vill. completed germination immediately
   after ripening while seeds of P. aurea Borkh., P. incana P. Gaertn., B.
   Mey. & Scherb., and P. reptans L. needed a 16-week period of cold
   stratification to break dormancy. GA(3) treatment did not substitute for
   cold stratification. The seeds of all species did not complete
   germination in darkness and showed maximal emergence on the soil
   surface, which suggests the formation of a persistent seed bank.
   Completion of germination was inhibited by decreasing osmotic potential
   and increasing salt concentration. The seeds of all species we studied
   can complete germination in both acidic and alkaline soils. These
   results suggest that under field conditions, if moisture and (or)
   salinity are not limiting factors and a seed is located on the soil
   surface, completion of germination of nondormant species (P. argentea
   and P. inclinata) is possible any month of the growing season.

   Experiments were also performed to study the effects of sowing depth and
   water supply on seedling emergence. There were no differences in
   germination between seeds incubated under light or dark conditions for
   any of the taxa we studied. Germination percentages increased
   significantly with increases in temperature. The taxa of Dianthus we
   studied showed similar responses to sand burial, i.e., seeds placed on
   or near the soil surface had maximum emergence, and emergence declined
   with increasing depth of seed burial. In the studied taxa, germination
   was reduced by declining osmotic potentials. Cold stratification
   increased the germination rate, but did not affect final germination
   percentage of Dianthus seeds. A higher concentration of nutritious
   solutions (KNO3) negatively affected the germination percentage. The
   results show that seeds of the studied taxa are potentially germinable
   in the species' habitat at any time between April and October.

   revegetation of species of thermophilous oak forest. To reveal this
   relationship effects of white, red, far-red irradiations and dark
   incubation on germination of eight Potentillo albae-Quercetum taxa were
   examined. Attempts were also made to evaluate the influence of
   gibberellic acid and different nitrogen sources on the germination
   characteristics. Interaction between light and nitrogen was also
   studied. Freshly matured seeds of all taxa germinated very poorly,
   indicating presence of primary dormancy. Germination rates increased
   after wet-stratification treatment and were low in darkness. The highest
   concentration of the nitrogenous solutions that resulted in high
   germination level was 10 mM, whereas higher concentrations had a
   negative effect. Nitrate had the strongest influence which can be proved
   by a `gap detection' mechanism for gaps in the vegetation. Far-red and
   red irradiation showed antagonistic effect on seed germination. There
   was a decrease in germination when far-red was followed by red and an
   improvement when red was followed by far-red treatment. Under red light,
   gibberellic acid enhanced germination of positively photoblastic taxa.
   It was concluded that light factor, associated with vegetation gaps, was
   the most important signal stimulating germination of the studied taxa.

AB The effects of cold stratification and gibberellic acid (GA(3)) on
   dormancy breaking for seeds of the annual halophyte species Juncus
   ranarius were tested. Germination percentage and recovery responses of
   salt stressed seeds were also tested. Freshly collected seeds germinated
   slowly under all incubation conditions. Thus, the seeds of]. ranarius
   have physiological dormancy, e.g. they are water permeable, have a fully
   developed embryo and require cold stratification to come out of
   dormancy. Furthermore, promotion of germination by GA(3) after-ripening
   in dry storage also indicated that these seeds have non-deep
   physiological dormancy. In general, the higher the GA(3) concentration,
   the more germination occurred within the studied range. Juncus ranarius
   demonstrated a germination preference for light. The highest germination
   percentage and rate of germination were recorded under constant light
   conditions at 22 degrees C after 24 weeks of cold stratification. In
   saline solutions, the highest percentage of germination was obtained at
   25 mM L-1 NaCl, and further increase in salinity resulted in a gradual
   decrease in germination. However, ungerminated seeds were not damaged by
   salt, showing a high level of recovery. The greater the reduction in
   salinity, the better the germination rate became. It was concluded that
   dormancy could be completely broken by cold stratification, indicating
   spring germination. Juncus ranarius can grow well at lower NaCl
   concentrations under constant light conditions at 22 degrees C.

AB The effects of incorporating plant growth regulators into the priming
   solution on low temperature germination and emergence percentage
   performance of sweet pepper (Capsicum annuum 'Demre') seeds before and
   after seed storage were investigated. Seeds were primed in 3% KNO3
   solution for 6 days at 25 degreesC in darkness containing one of the
   following: 1, 3, 5, or 10 mum methyl jasmonate (MeJA) or 0.05, 0.1, 0.5,
   or 1 mM acetyl salicylic acid (ASA). Following priming, seeds were
   either immediately subjected to germination and emergence tests at 15
   degreesC or stored at 4 degreesC for 1 month after which they were
   subjected to germination test at 15 degreesC. Priming pepper seeds in
   the presence or absence of plant growth regulators in general improved
   final germination percentage (FGP), germination rate (G(50)) and
   germination synchrony (G(10-90)) at 15 degreesC compared to nonprimed
   seeds which had an FGP of 44%, G(50) of 7.3 days and G(10-90) of 7.3
   days. Priming seeds in KNO3 solution containing 0.1 mM of ASA resulted
   in the highest germination percentage (91%), fastest germination rate
   (G(50) = 2.2 days) and the most synchronous germination (G(50) = 6.1
   days). Emergence percentages were the highest for the seeds primed in
   the presence of 0.1 mM ASA (85%) and 3 muM MeJA (84%) while nonprimed
   seeds had an emergence percentage of 40%. Fastest emergence rates (E-50)
   were also obtained from seeds primed in KNO3 supplemented with 3 mum
   MeJA (E-50 = 15.2 days) and 0.1 mM ASA (E-50 = 15.2 days). Shoot fresh
   and dry eights of pepper seedlings were significantly affected by
   priming treatments and priming in the presence of 0.1 mM ASA resulted in
   highest seedling shoot fresh and dry weights. Although all priming
   treatments improved germination performance of pepper seeds at 15
   degreesC following 1 month of storage, inclusion of 0.1 mM ASA into the
   priming solution resulted in the highest germination percentage (84%)
   and germination rate (G(50) = 3.8 days). These results indicate that
   priming seeds in 0.1 mM of ASA or 3 mum MeJA incorporated into the KNO3
   solution can be used as an effective method to improve low temperature
   performance of sweet pepper seeds and that these seeds can be stored for
   1 month at 4 degreesC and still exhibit improved germination performance
   at 15 degreesC.

AB The tree tomato (Solanum betaceum) is a poorly known species that has
   fruits with great economic potential, as it can be consumed in natura or
   industrialized. However, for reaching this potential, it is necessary
   the development of technologies for seedlings production. The
   propagation of this species is mainly done by seeds, but the seed
   germination process is usually slow, especially under stress conditions.
   This study aimed at verifying whether tree tomato seeds have dormancy
   and which is the best method to obtain fast and uniform germination. A
   completely randomized design was adopted in a 5*2 factorial arrangement
   (methods to overcome dormancy * light), with four replications of 50 or
   60 seeds, depending on the production cycle. The methods tested were
   cold stratification, hydropriming, priming with GA3 solution and
   control, with or without light. Seed germination and germination rate
   index, as well as the beginning and average time of germination, were
   also evaluated. The use of GA3 at a concentration of 100 mg L-1 or 300
   mg L-1 is recommended to the germination of tree tomato seeds.

AB One of the problems of propagation of lindens (Tilia spp.) is low seed

   angulata collected from middle altitude (500 m a.s.l.) and high altitude
   (1500 m a.s.l.) of Chamestan forests (northern Iran) were examined. In
   both altitudinal seed sources, immature seeds with pericarp were
   subjected to (1) cold stratification, and (2) imbibed with NaOH
   (30%)+cold stratification. Also, immature seeds without pericarp were
   examined as (1) imbibed with GA3 (500 mg/l)+cold stratification, and (2)
   kinetin acid (1 mg/l)+cold stratification. The most germination
   percentage (87%) allocated to non-pericarp seeds of higher altitude,
   treated respectively, with (1) GA3+cold stratification, and (2) kinetin
   acid+cold stratification. The most germination speed (6 seeds/week)
   belonged to seeds of with pericarp collected from middle altitude,
   treated respectively with (1) cold stratification, and (2) imbibed with
   GA3+cold stratification. The lowest mean germination time (20 days)
   allocated to seeds with pericarp of middle altitude (only cold
   stratified). Generally, even though, non-pericarp immature seeds of
   higher altitude, imbibed with GA3 (and kinetin acid)+cold stratification
   had favorable germination percentage, the immature seeds with pericarp
   of lower altitude (only cold stratified) represented satisfaction
   germination percentage along the shorter period. However, in future
   investigations, effect of treatments on seed vigor index and growth of
   Tilia seedling in order to employ the proper method for seed propagation
   and seedling production of this species in nursery are advised.

AB Germination of three closely related species from the Myosotis palustris
   group (M. nemorosa, M. palustris subsp. laxiflora, M. caespitosa)
   differing in their habitats and capacity for clonal growth, was compared
   in two greenhouse experiments. To evaluate both inter- and intraspecific
   variation, each species was represented by seeds from several
   populations. Final germination percentage and germination rates T-50
   were compared both between species and populations within species. In
   the first experiment, we studied the influence of two external factors,
   moisture and light. Four moisture levels (dry, wet, periodically flooded
   and permanently flooded soil) and three types of shading (without
   shading, shaded with green foil, shaded with solid paper sheet) were
   combined in a complete factorial design. In all three species, total
   germination percentage was the same in the three wettest treatments, and
   decreased in the dry treatment. Germination in the treatments shaded
   with green foil (simulating vegetation cover, which changed light
   quality) was significantly slower than in treatments without shading and
   treatments shaded with a solid paper sheet. There were significant
   differences among species, but we also found very pronounced differences
   among populations within a species. M. caespitosa had the uniformly
   highest germination percentage (reaching in some cases 100%) and also
   fastest germination. Germination of M. palustris subsp. laxiflora
   populations was slower and reached lower final proportions, and medium
   variability among populations. Inter-population variability in the final
   germination percentage was highest, and the final germination the lowest
   in M. nemorosa. In addition, M. nemorosa, a species typical for
   permanent meadow communities was delayed by permanent flooding. In the
   second experiment, we studied the effects of seed age and storage
   conditions. Three combinations of seed age and storage were used:
   younger seeds (half year old) with no-chilling, younger seeds with
   chilling and old seeds (three years old) with chilling. M. caespitosa
   had again the highest final germination percentage and fastest
   germination rates T-50. In addition, final germination percentage of
   this species slightly increased with seed age, whereas it decreased in
   the other two species. The germination behaviour corresponded well to
   expectation based on species life histories and habitat preferences.
   Remarkably stable and high germination percentages and fastest
   germination rates T-50 were ascertained in M. caespitosa, a species of
   disturbed habitats, with lowest capacity for clonal spread. M. palustris
   subsp. laxiflora (species with highest clonal capacity) and M. nemorosa
   (species with medium clonal potential) achieved lower, but still very
   high final germination percentage. In addition, M. nemorosa showed the
   highest inter-populations variability in our experiments.

AB We investigated the germination traits of Fraxinus lanuginosa fruits
   collected in Yamagata Prefecture, in the northern part of Honshu, Japan.
   While fruits set at 5°C were in quiescence showing negligible
   germination, more than 90% of germinations were obtained from fruits set
   at temperatures above 10°C. These results indicate that the fruits of F.
   lanuginousa do not acquire dormancy. Since removal of the pericarp from
   the seed significantly enhanced the germination rate, intact fruit
   showed delayed germination due to pericarp. Further experiments on
   pericarp revealed that germination delay was caused by the hardness of
   the pericarp, which mechanically inhibits the inner embryo from growing.
   Moist chilling treatment for three months improved germination rate
   which suggests that cold moist conditions under snow cover during the
   winter season removes the mechanical inhibition and fruits will
   germinate simultaneously at the beginning of the following spring. The
   above results were opposite that in a previous paper using the fruits
   from Hokkaido showing dormancy; thus geographical variation in
   germination/dormancy traits might exist in F. lanuginousa fruits.

   seeds were also subjected to different methods of disinfection with the
   use of Domestos household bleach, chloramine or calcium hypochlorite).
   E1 and E2 ensured satisfactory seed germination. The number of
   adventitious roots varied within wide limits (from 10 to 30). All the

AB Sufficient information about the quality characteristics of on-site

   endangered grassland communities is a precondition for its successful
   use. In order to determine the necessary seed rate and the best-suited
   application method, information about thousand seed weight, purity and
   germination capacity of the material is essential. Seed mixtures from a
   herb-rich Molinion litter meadow, harvested with two different methods:
   (i) on-site threshing (OST) and (ii) seed stripping (SS), were assessed.
   The purity of stripped material exceeded 60% and was around 20% higher
   compared to OST. The germination capacity of the harvested pure seeds
   treated with and without pre-chilling was investigated. Slight
   differences between harvesting methods could be observed, whereas
   pre-chilling of the seed material caused a significant increase in
   germination capacity of the seed material. The total germination rate
   did not exceed 30%. Litter meadows contain a high percentage of dormant
   seeds. This refers to the practical experience that optimal restoration
   success can be reached if reseeding of Molinion meadows takes place at
   the end of the season.

   germination dynamics is of a two-peak (autumn, spring) rhythmic
   character. The duration of dormancy (20-93 days) and germination (98-386
   days) of  seeds are interrelated and depend on the storage periods and
   seedling. The pre-sowing treatment of seeds with H3BO3, germination in
   soil and in the darkness, laser intensify seed germination rate and
   energy. Such factors as stratification, scarification, H2O2 and plant
   extracts' treatment, vitamin enrichment and coverage of seeds decrease

   mountain holly seeds, involves pretreating holly seeds and performing
   seed germination. The seed germination involves embedding pretreated
   holly seeds in wet sand and subjecting the embedded seeds to
   stratification process. The stratification process involves (a)
   promoting seed germination at 20-30 degrees C under a shady environment
   for 50-60 days, (b) separating the seeds and wet sand, soaking the seeds
   in a processing liquid at 15-25 degrees C for 4-6 hours, where the
   processing liquid comprises 300-400 mg/l zinc sulfate, 100-150 mg/l
   cytokinin and 200-250 mg/l ethylene, and (c) adding the soaked seeds to
   wet sand and germinating at 1-5 degrees C for 100-130 days.

AB Vicia hirsuta (L.) Gray S.F. (tiny vetch) is a common and persistent
   segetal weed. Tiny vetch seeds and pods reach different stages of
   maturity during the crop harvest season. Some seeds that mature before
   cereal harvest are shed in the field and deposited in the soil seed
   bank, while others become incorporated into seed material.The objective
   of this study was to describe selected aspects of tiny vetch seed
   ecology: to determine the rate of individual reproduction of vetch
   plants growing in winter and spring grain crops and to evaluate the
   germination of seeds at different stages of maturity, subject to storage
   conditions.The seeds and pods of V. hirsuta were sorted according to
   their development stages at harvest and divided into two groups. The
   first group was stored under laboratory conditions for two months. In
   the autumn of the same year, the seeds were subjected to germination
   tests. The remaining seeds were stored in a storeroom, and were planted
   in soil in the spring. The germination rate was evaluated after 8 months
   of storage.Potential productivity (developed pods and flowers, fruit
   buds) was higher in plants fruiting in winter wheat than in spring
   barley. Vetch plants produced around 17-26% more pods (including
   cracked, mature, greenish-brown and green pods) and around 25% less buds
   in winter wheat than in spring barley.Immature seeds were characterized
   by the highest germination capacity. Following storage under laboratory
   conditions and stratification in soil, mature seeds germinated at a rate
   of several percent. After storage in a storeroom, seeds at all three
   development stages broke dormancy at a rate of 72-75%. The high
   germination power of tiny vetch seeds stored in a storeroom indicates
   that this plant can be classified as an obligatory speirochoric weed
   species.

AB Seed germination requirements are important for the conservation and
   propagation of Eucomis autumnalis subsp. autumnalis, a threatened, yet
   widely utilized medicinal plant in southern Africa. In this study,
   conditions to maximize germination were investigated. The seeds of E.
   autumnalis were subjected to various environmental factors such as
   constant and alternating temperature regimes, cold stratification,
   temperature shifts and light/dark conditions. Effects of smoke-water and
   the newly identified smoke-compound (3-methyl-2H-furo[2,3-c]pyran-2-one)
   were tested on germination. At 20 degrees C and alternating temperature
   (30/15 degrees C) under a 16:8 h light/dark regime, germination was
   improved. The highest percentage germination (100%) was achieved with a
   mean germination time (MGT) of 30.6 +/- 1.3 days, when the seeds were
   subjected to constant dark at room temperature (25 +/- 0.5 degrees C).
   This indicates the negative photoblastic characteristic of E. autumnalis
   seeds. The species is associated with high-altitude regions. Cold
   stratification (5 degrees C) for 45 days significantly improved the
   percentage germination (90%) as compared to nonstratified controls (40%)
   when subsequently incubated at 25 +/- 0.5 degrees C under a 16:8 h
   light/dark regime. Seeds treated with
   3(..)methyl-2H-furo[2,3-c]pyran-2-one and incubated in constant light or
   a 16:8 h light: dark photoperiod germinated better (86.7% and 66.7%,
   respectively) compared to the controls (55% and 40%, respectively). This
   smoke-derived compound substituted for the dark and cold stratification
   requirements for the germination of E. autumnalis seeds. (c) 2005 SAAB.

AB Germination of nine important medicinal plant species from the high
   altitudes of southern Africa was investigated in relation to different
   environmental parameters. The seeds were subjected to different constant
   and alternating temperatures, temperature shifts, light and dark
   conditions, and cold stratification periods. Temperature regimes of
   17-23degreesC appear most suitable for optimal germination for all the
   species examined. In some species, a temperature shift from 10degreesC
   to 20degreesC and 30degreesC to 20degreesC improved the final percentage
   germination. In the majority of the species investigated, exposure of
   seeds to continuous or alternating light significantly promoted
   germination over continuous dark. However, no phytochrome effect was
   determined. Tulbaghia alliacea and Dianthus basuticus germinated equally
   well in light and dark, while Urginea capitata responded significantly
   to the continuous light treatment. In some species, cold stratification
   stimulated germination and reduced the mean germination time.

AB Hydrogen peroxide is most stable molecule among reactive oxygen species,
   which play a vital role in growth and development of plant as signaling
   molecule at low concentration in response to various abiotic and biotic
   stresses. Exogenous application of H2O2 is known to induce chilling
   tolerance in plants. Brassinosteroids are plant steroid hormones known
   for their anti-stress properties. In this study, effect of exogenous
   H2O2 on antioxidant defense system of Brassica juncea L. seedlings was
   investigated in 24-epibrassinolide (24-EBL) treated and untreated
   seedlings under chilling stress. The surface sterilized seeds of B.
   juncea L. were germinated in petriplates containing different
   concentrations of H2O2 alone and in combination with 10(-8)M 24-EBL.
   Chilling treatment (4 degrees C) was given to 10-days old seedlings
   grown in different treatments for 6 h daily up to 3 days. 24 h recovery
   period was given to chilling treated seedlings by placing at 25 degrees
   C +/- 2 degrees C and harvested for antioxidant enzymes on 14(th) day
   after sowing (DAS). Treatment of 24-EBL in combination with H2O2 (15 and
   20 mM) helped in reducing the toxicity of seed and seedlings due to H2O2
   exposure on their germination rate, shoot and root length respectively.
   24-EBL treatment at seed and seedling stage helped in alleviating the
   toxic effect of H2O2 through antioxidant defense system by increasing
   the activities of various enzymes involved in antioxidant defense system
   such as catalase (CAT, E.C. 1.11.1.6), ascorbate peroxidase (APDX, E.C.
   1.11.1.11), and superoxide dismutase (SOD, E.C. 1.15.1.1). In
   conclusion, exogenous pretreatment of H2O2 to seeds of B. juncea L.
   adapted the seedlings to tolerate chilling stress, which was further
   ameliorated in combination of H2O2 with 24-EBL.

   germination, 400 seeds of each species were steeped in a brassinosteroid
   solution and then placed for germination in a growth chamber under (i)
   optimal humidity and (ii) temporary drought stress (except for oak).
   Drought stress significantly reduced the germination capacity and
   germination rate in the control treatments of Norway spruce, Scots pine
   and Douglas fir. Nonetheless, the application of brassinosteroid
   significantly reduced the drought-stress effects in seeds of Norway
   spruce and Scots pine. The drought-stressed Douglas fir did not respond
   positively to the brassinosteroid application. English oak was
   germinated only under the optimal humidity regime and no differences in
   germination were detected between the control and
   brassinosteroid-treated acorns.

   increased with increasing cone size and large cones contained more
   seeds. Seed wt. had no effect on germination percent or rate or on

   [seedling] survival percent and early growth rate. Seeds imbibed with
   solutions of various osmotic agents (NaCl, KCl or PEG 6000 at water
   potentials of -3.25 to -23.4 bar) on filter paper did not germinate
   after 10 days until the imbibing sol. was changed to water; germination
   of some treatments was then higher than that of control seeds. Some
   seeds in a low concn. of salt sol. (water potential <-11.09 bar)
   germinated after 15 days. Survival of germinants of C. equisetifolia

   at 25/15, 20/10, and 15/6Â°C with final germination rates of 86%, 66%,
   and 66%, respectively, indicating that these seeds have no physiological
   dormancy (PD). However, V.albida seeds were found to have PD, since
   germination hardly occurred during the 4-week experiment, and the final
   germination rate was 50% or less. When the seeds of V. albida were
   treated with GA3 1000 mg･L-1, the final germination rate was 100%.
   Moreover, the germination rate increased as the period of cold
   stratification for V. albida seeds increased. The germination
   characteristics of Viola seeds were also examined from seeds harvested
   in 2019.V. mandshurica seeds germinated at 25/15Â°C in one week, but the
   mean germination time decreased compared to seeds that were stored for 4
   years. This shows that V.mandshurica has reduced seed viability during
   storage. V.albida seeds that were harvested in 2019 hardly germinated
   within the 4-week experiment, and the germination rate increased through
   cold stratification. Therefore, the seeds of V. mandshurica and V.
   albida do not change the seed dormancy type, but the seed viability
   might be affected by the type of long-term storage used.
AK 본 연구는 제비꽃과 남산제비꽃 종자의 종자휴면을 구명하고 종자 저장에 따른 발아 특성을 알아보는 것을 목표로 하고있다. 먼저 장기
   저장 종자를 대상으로 다양한 배양 온도, 저온층적처리, GA3처리를 수행하였다. 휴면의 유무를 판단하기위해 종자를 25/15,
   20/10, 15/6Â°C 온도에서 배양하였고 제비꽃 종자의 최종 발아율이 각각 86, 66, 66%으로 나타났다. 이는 제비꽃
   종자에 휴면이 없는 것으로 여겨진다. 남산제비꽃은 최종 발아율이 50% 이하이며, 4주 이내에 거의 발아를 하지 않아 생리적휴면이
   있다고 판단된다. 남산제비꽃 종자에GA3 1000mg･L-1를 처리했을 때 최종 발아율이 100%로 나타났다. 또한 저온층적처리
   실험 결과 남산제비꽃 종자가 저온층적처리 기간이 증가할수록 최종발아율도 증가하였다. 앞의실험은 장기 저장이 되었던 종자를 사용한
   것이며 채종 직후의 제비꽃, 남산제비꽃의 발아양상도 살펴보았다. 제비꽃은25/15Â°C에서 1주 만에 모두 발아를 하여 종자
   휴면이 없는 것을 다시 확인하였다. 장기 저장 종자에 비해 평균발아일수가줄어들고 발아속도가 증가하여 제비꽃 종자는 장기 저장
   중에종자의 활력이 감소됨을 알 수 있었다. 바로 채종한 남산제비꽃 종자도 4주만에 발아가 거의 이루어지지 않고 저온층적처리를 통해
   발아율이 향상 되는 것으로 보아 생리적휴면을 가지고 있다고 재확인되었다. 따라서 제비꽃과 남산제비꽃은 장기 저장에 따라 종자의
   휴면 유형은 변하지 않지만 종자 활력에 따라서 최종발아율, 평균 발아일수, 발아속도, 발아균일도가 달라질 수 있다.

AB Abies chensiensis, an endangered plant mainly distributed in Qinling
   Mountains and Dabashan Mountains, was listed as one of national
   protected plants at second category in China. There have been no reports
   about the study of seed germinating characteristics of A. chensiensis
   until now. The objectives of this study were to 1) identify whether cold
   stratification was effective for breaking the dormancy of A. chensiensis
   seeds and find out the optimum duration of cold stratification; 2)
   determine the optimal temperature for germination and whether
   alternating temperatures affected germination; 3) test whether
   germination was affected by light; 4) choose the better germination
   texture between silver sand and filter paper. The 1 000-seed weight of
   A. chensiensis was (33.92+-1.01) g, which was higher than other fir
   seeds. The viability of seedlot was tested by TTC (1.0%). The results of
   seed dissection, reflecting the high seed abortion, showed that the
   percentages of viable seeds, empty seed and shrunken seeds were 26.00%,
   20.50% and 33.75%, respectively. Germination tests were performed to
   determine the effects of cold stratification (4degreeC for 0, 14, 21 and
   28 days), temperatures (two constant temperatures 20degreeC, 25degreeC
   and an alternating 20-30degreeC), light (in light of 8 hcntdotd-1, 100
   mumolcntdotm-2cntdots-1 and in darkness) and germination textures
   (filter paper and silver sand) on germination rate. The results showed
   that cold stratification could increase seed germination percentage and
   germination energy; the longer the duration of cold stratification, the
   higher the germination rate; but the percentages of germination energy
   did not increase if the duration was longer than 21 days. 25degreeC was
   not better for the seed germination percentage, but was better for
   germination energy than the other two temperature regimes, because a
   9-day treatment showed 90% of the biggest germination percentage in
   25degreeC; and the alternating 20-30degreeC did not increase the
   germination percentages of the seeds of A. chensiensis. Compared with
   those in darkness, light (8 hcntdotd-1, 100 mumolcntdotm-2cntdots-1) did
   not increase germination percentages, although it did increase
   germination energy; light was not indispensable for germination of A.
   chensiensis seeds, but did accelerate the process of germination. Great
   differences were found for germination percentage and germination energy
   in two germination textures; the percentages of germination and
   germination energy on silver sand were 19.75% and 16.75% respectively,
   but 8.00% and 6.00% on filter paper. The result showed that the silver
   sand was a better germination texture for A. chensiensis seeds than
   filter paper, perhaps because silver sand could offer more sufficient
   water for the germination of bigger seeds such as A. chensiensis than
   filter paper.

   (control) or with solutions of ethephon, ACC, AVG or silver thiosulfate.
   Ethephon (200 mg/litre) and ACC (50 M) improved both the percentage
   germination and rate of germination, assessed over 7 weeks. AVG (50 M)
   slowed down germination during the first 4 weeks (4% compared with 17%
   for control) although after 7 weeks the total percentage germination was
   similar for AVG-treated and control seeds. Silver thiosulfate (2.5 mM)
   did not affect germination significantly. In a second experiment, seeds
   were chilled at 10°C for 5 or 15 days before being treated with water
   (control), ethephon (100 mg/litre) or silver thiosulfate (2.5 mM) as
   before. Ethephon improved the germination rate, especially during the
   first 5-6 weeks of the 9-week trial and especially in seeds chilled for
   5 days. Silver thiosulfate reduced both the percentage germination and
   the germination rate of seeds chilled for 5 days but had no adverse
   effect with seeds chilled for 15 days. Chilling did not enhance
   germination, in comparison with the unchilled seeds in the first
   experiment.

AB Plant reintroductions have become an important component of species
   recovery strategies. To favor establishment and survival rates of
   reintroduced specimens, the use of mature individuals is often
   recommended. Producing individuals from seed can be challenging, because
   little is known about the germination requirements of many endangered
   species. Here, we investigated whether Carex lupuliformis achenes can be
   germinated at high rates under semi-controlled ex situ conditions. More
   specifically, we aimed to determine which simple stratification
   technique allows higher/faster germination rates, whether scarification
   speeds up the germination process, and which light intensity allows
   higher/faster germination rates. We found that a brief cold-wet
   stratification (one month in wet sand) increases the likelihood that C.
   lupuliformis achenes will germinate, but that a similar germination rate
   can be obtained by storing achenes at 4 degrees C for six months in a
   plastic bag. Although scarification did not affect final germination
   rates, scarified achenes germinated significantly faster than
   unscarified ones. Finally, we found that a light intensity of 25%
   resulted in significantly higher final germination rates than lower
   light intensities. In conclusion, our experiments showed that C.
   lupuliformis is easy to propagate ex situ, as a variety of treatments
   resulted in relatively high germination rates.

AB The effect of temperature alternations on the release of primary embryo
   dormancy and induction of secondary dormancy is very poorly understood.
   The topics were studied in seeds of the woody taxa Amelanchier
   canadensis, Malus sargentii, Pyrus communis, and Berberis thunbergii.
   Fully imbibed seeds of Pyrus communis, Malus sargentii, and Amelanchier
   canadensis were placed at 5degreesC for cold stratification and
   germination. High temperature treatments were applied by transferring
   seeds to 25degreesC for two weeks and subsequently returning seeds to
   5degreesC. The high temperature treatment increased the time to 50%
   germination (T-50) from 16.0 to 23.1 weeks in Amelanchier canadensis,
   from 12.3 to 22.7 weeks in Malus sargentii, and from 16.4 to 21.8 weeks
   in Pyrus communis. The delay in germination indicates that the high
   temperature not only delayed the dormancy release processes but also
   reverted the seeds into a state of deeper dormancy than seeds of the
   control treatment, i.e. induction of secondary dormancy. The high
   temperature treatment often induced a more uniform germination compared
   to the control at 5degreesC continuously. Seeds of Berberis thunbergii
   were placed at 5degreesC, and after 14 days the treatment was
   interrupted by a period at 25degreesC lasting for 0 (control), 1, 3, 5,
   10, 15, 20 and 25 days, respectively, and seeds were then returned to
   5degreesC. Final germination percentages (ranging from 78 to 87%) did
   not differ among treatments. The 1, 3 and 5 days treatments did not
   affect T-50, but after 10 to 25 days at 25degreesC T-50 increased. The
   delay in germination increased linearly with time at 25degreesC but with
   a slope of 2.19, indicating that seeds gradually reverted to a state of
   deeper dormancy. The results suggest that in Berberis thunbergii, a
   period of more than 5 days at 25degreesC is required to induce secondary
   dormancy. The relationship between delay of primary dormancy and
   induction of secondary dormancy is discussed.

AB Barley (1 -> 3,1 -> 4)-beta-glucan endohydrolases (beta-glucanases; EI
   and EII) are primarily responsible for hydrolyzing high molecular weight
   (1 -> 3,1 -> 4)-beta-glucans (beta-glucan) during germination.
   Incomplete endosperm modification during malting results in residual
   beta-glucan that can contribute to increased wort Viscosity and beer
   chill haze. Four newly identified forms of EI and EII and the reference
   enzymes EI-a and EII-a were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the
   recombinant proteins were characterized for enzyme inetics and
   thermostability. EI and EII variants that exhibited higher residual
   beta-glucanase activity than EI-a and EII-a after heat treatment also
   exhibited increased substrate affinity and decreased turnover rates. The
   novel EII-1 form exhibited significantly increased thermostability
   compared with the reference EII-a when activity was measured at elevated
   temperature. EII-1 exhibited a T-50 value, which indicates the
   temperature at which 50% of beta-glucanase activity remains, 1.3 degrees
   C higher than that of EII-a. The irreversible thermal inactivation
   difference between EII-a and EII-1 after 5 min of heat treatment at 56
   degrees C was 11.9%. The functional significance of the three amino acid
   differences between EII-a and EII-1 was examined by making combinatorial
   mutations, in EII-a using site-directed mutagenesis. The S20G and D284E
   amino acid substitutions were shown to be responsible for the increase
   in EII-1 thermostability.

AB The incorporation of native plant species is central to restoration
   efforts, but this is often limited by both the availability of seeds and
   the relatively low viability and germination rates of commercially
   available seeds. Although pre-sowing treatments are commonly used to
   improve germination rates of seeds, the efficacy of these treatments is
   found to vary across species. In this study, we tested how four pre-sow
   treatments (physical scarification, acid scarification, cold
   stratification, and aerated hydropriming) affected the viability and
   seed germination rates of 12 commercially available plant species native
   to south Texas and commonly used in restoration efforts. Our results
   show that the viability of the seeds have a wide range, from 78% to
   1.25%. Similarly, the total germination rate ranged from 62% to 0%. We
   found that pre-sowing treatments accelerated the germination rate in 9
   of 12 plant species tested, but the effect varied by treatment.
   Collectively, our results identify various methods to achieve the best
   germination rates for native plants of south Texas, to help improve
   restoration efforts across the region.

AB We examined whether the presence or absence of different environmental
   stressors influenced the reproductive potential of a saltmarsh species -
   Plantago maritima. We focused on total seed output, seed quality and
   biomass of progeny. So far, there are no studies trying to answer the
   question of how different saltmarsh management affects the quality of
   seed in saltmarsh species. For the purposes of the study, plots
   subjected to light mowing, light or heavy grazing, trampling or rooting
   were designated in three nature reserves in Poland. On each plot, the
   abundance of infructescences per sq. metre was calculated. Mature
   infructascences were collected and their length and no of fruit capsules
   were measured. The seeds obtained from fruit capsules were weighted and
   sown in controlled conditions. The germination rate and the final
   germination percentage were calculated. A representative number of
   sprouts were grown. After a period of two months, the specimens were
   harvested and their total dry mass was measured. It was found that heavy
   grazing had the greatest effect on all of the studied characteristics.
   The presence of this factor resulted in shorter infructescences with a
   smaller number of fruit capsules. However, this phenomenon was
   compensated by the higher abundance of infructescences per sq. metre. At
   the same time seeds produced by grazed specimens were significantly
   lighter. Interestingly, intensive trampling by people affected Plantago
   maritima specimens in a similar way to heavy grazing, while mowing and
   rooting had less impact on the considered characteristics. Although a
   positive correlation between seed mass and germination success was
   found, the altogether lower seed mass had a negligible effect on
   germination parameters. Also, the differences in seed parameters did not
   affect dry mass of obtained progeny grown in lab conditions. Samples
   were collected during the first week of September 2016 in the three
   populations of Plantago maritima. We selected a set of 72 plots that
   differed in the types of management: sites lightly mowed - mowed
   once/twice a year (MowL), lightly grazed - sites avoided by cattle,
   rarely grazed with higher vegetation (GrazL), heavily grazed - sites
   preferred by cattle with short vegetation (GrazH), heavy trampled -
   sites along the pathways intensively used by tourists (TramH), old marks
   of wild boar rooting - uneven surface, but almost completely overgrown
   by plants (RootOld), fresh marks of rooting - uneven surface with a
   significant share of bare soil (RootNew). Infructescence density per one
   sq. metre was calculated on every plot. Additionally, 254
   infructescences (Table 1) were collected randomly from the plots, stored
   in envelopes and air dried for two weeks. After drying, the length of
   each infructescence was measured with a resolution of 1 mm and the
   number of fruit capsules were counted. The average length of
   infructescences was multiplied by their number per 1 sq. m in order to
   estimate the potential for seed production per site (seed yeald).
   Germination test and growth experiment From each infructescence, a total
   of 30 randomly chosen seeds were weighed with a resolution of 1/100 mg.
   The seeds were subjected to stratification at 5 ˚C for 60 days, then
   planted in a growth chamber in germination tanks on filter paper. The
   germination regime was set with a 25 ˚C light(18h)/20˚C dark (8h). Light
   was supplied from warm white fluorescent tubes. The constant high
   moisture of the substrate was sustained with deionized water as it is
   known of Plantago maritima that its seeds germinate best in distilled
   water (Lotschert, 1970).The effects of germination - the number of
   emerging sprouts and their condition were checked daily for a period of
   14 days as it was determined that this period was enough for an average
   seed to germinate completely, and after that period almost no new
   sprouts appeared. The seeds were considered to have germinated when the
   radicle and two cotyledons were present. Mean germination time (MGT) was
   calculated by using the equation: MGT =  (n * d) /N, where n = number of
   seeds germinated on each day, d = number of days from the beginning of
   the test, and N = total number of seeds germinated at the termination of
   the experiment (Ellis & Roberts, 1981). After germination, a
   representative number of sprouts (Table 1) for every variant of
   management were grown in a separate pots filled with organic soil. After
   a period of two months, just before the plants started allocating
   material to reproductive organs, the specimens were harvested, separated
   into underground and aboveground parts, and their dry mass was measured.
   Statistical Analysis To test the influence of the environmental
   stressors on each of the response variables eight multivariate linear
   regression models were performed. The statistical significance level of
   all regression coefficients and models were established as alpha = 0.05.
   All of the independent variables were coded binary, in which "1"
   represents the influence of a particular stressor and "0" - the absence
   of a particular stressor. In some cases, the response variables were
   influenced simultaneously by more than one stressor (by two: in 39 cases
   by bough MowL and GrazH, in 4 cases - MowL and RootOld, in 4 cases -
   MowL * RootNew, in 4 cases - GrazH * RootOld, in 4 cases - GrazL *
   RootNew; by tree: in 4 cases - MowL * GrazL * RootNew) therefore all the
   stressors were tested simultaneously in one linear model. Depending on
   the skewness, the response data were normalized by logarithm log(x+1),
   square-root or square transformation (compare Table 2). To describe the
   importance of the environmental stressor influence, the percentage of
   each explained variation was calculated. Statistical analysis were
   performed in R (R Core Team, 2017), data visualisations were performed
   using ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016) and ggridges packages (Wilke, 2018) in R
   studio (RStudio Team, 2015). The correlations between measured variables
   were tested with the Pearsons coefficient. Data for: Lazarus et al.

   Thalictrum uchiyamae Nakai (Seoul Meadow Rue). The seed was elongated
   and tapering at both ends, and its length and width were 1.810-2.744 and
   0.576-0.989 mm, respectively. When the seeded seeds were planted
   immediately, the germination rate was less than 5% at 15/6 degrees C or
   20/10 degrees C, but after cold stratification for 8 weeks at 5 degrees
   C, the germination rate exceeded 80% at 30/20 degrees C, 20/10 degrees
   C, and 15/6 degrees C. Thus, it was confirmed that T. uchiyamae seeds
   are morphophysiologically dormant. The physiological changes in the
   seeds during cold stratification were investigated in terms of
   proteomics; the number of activated proteins increased from 330 to 353
   after cold stratification. We confirmed that the disappearance of or
   decrease in tunicamycin and phytochrome is associated with the breaking
   of dormancy in T. uchiyamae seeds.

AB Seed dormancy facilitates to endure environmental disadvantages by
   confining embryonic growth until the seeds encounter favorable
   environmental conditions for germination. Abscisic acid (ABA) and
   gibberellic acid (GA) play a pivotal role in the determination of the
   seed dormancy state. ABA establishes seed dormancy, while GA triggers
   seed germination. Here, we demonstrate that MYB96 contributes to the
   fine-tuning of seed dormancy regulation through the coordination of ABA
   and GA metabolism. The MYB96-deficient myb96-1 seeds germinated earlier
   than wild-type seeds, whereas delayed germination was observed in the
   activation-tagging myb96-1D seeds. The differences in germination rate
   disappeared after stratification or after-ripening. The MYB96
   transcription factor positively regulates ABA biosynthesis genes
   9-CIS-EPOXYCAROTENOID DIOXYGENASE 2 (NCED2), NCED5, NCED6, and NCED9,
   and also affects GA biosynthetic genes GA3ox1 and GA20ox1. Notably,
   MYB96 directly binds to the promoters of NCED2 and NCED6, primarily
   modulating ABA biosynthesis, which subsequently influences GA
   metabolism. In agreement with this, hyperdormancy of myb96-1D seeds was
   recovered by an ABA biosynthesis inhibitor fluridone, while hypodormancy
   of myb96-1 seeds was suppressed by a GA biosynthesis inhibitor
   paclobutrazol (PAC). Taken together, the metabolic balance of ABA and GA
   underlies MYB96 control of primary seed dormancy.

   results are summarized as follows: 1. The pollen viability of native
   azaleas such as Rhododendron mucronulatum, R. schlippenbachii, R.
   vedoense var. poukhanense was generally longer than introduced azaleas
   such as R. simsii hybrids (cv. Mission Bell) and R. mucronatum. All
   azaleas except R. mucronulatum used in this experiment did not germinate
   after 150 days storage at room temperature condition, whereas pollen
   viability of R. mucronulatum showed less than 10%. Native three azaleas
   increased the preservation ability as the temperature got below 5 degree
   C. The pollen survival rate of the azalea showed high pollen survival
   rate at -20 degree C as well as -10 degree C. R. simsii hybrids (cv.
   Mission Bell) and R. mucronatum did not survive at 5 degree C, and they
   showed less than 10% survival at -10 degree C and -20 degree C. 2.
   Pollen viability of native three azaleas were relatively kept very high
   in 60 days at 5 degree C, and the high pollen germination rate was
   maintained until 150 days, while less than 10% survival rate except R.
   mucronulatum was observed after 300 days at 5 degree C storage, the
   pollen germinations viability of R. obtusum (cv. Mother's Day) were very
   low during whole period. R. japonicum showed more or less high pollen
   viability in 60 days whereas they were less than 10%, and completely
   dead after 300 days. 3. The pollen lethality by high temperature
   treatment on R. yedoense var. poukhanense whereas R. schlippenbachii was
   influenced to 50% survival under the treatment of 50 degree C for one
   hour, whereas it was completely dead 50% for 16 hours in R. yedoense
   var. poukhanense, whereas R. schlippenbachii gave results less than 9%
   survival. In the treatment of 70 degree C for one hour and four hours
   pollen survival was very low and for 16 hours all were dead. While in
   the temperature of 90 degree C treatment, they showed all death for one
   hour and for four hours and 16 hours as well. 4. In the pollen survival
   rate by the treatment of different concentration and dipping time of
   methyl alcohol, R. schlippenbachii was as a whole higher than R.
   yedoense var. poukhanense. The most of pollens were survived by the
   treatment at the 25% concentration of methyl alcohol from one to 10
   minutes dipping, whereas 50% concentration of it showed high pollen
   survival until two minutes. Pollen survival rate in 25% showed on the
   decrease by the gradual increase of dipping time. The methyl alcohol
   concentration of complete lethality was at 75% for more than 10 minutes
   dipping on R. yedoense var. poukhanense. In anhydride methyl alcohol, R.
   yedoense var. poukhanense was all dead for one minute and for two
   minutes in R. schlippenbachii.

AB To find out optimal priming condition, hot pepper (Capsicum annum L.)
   seeds were primed with different concentrations, treatment duration and
   temperatures of osmotica. Primed seeds were dried back at 15, 20, and
   25degreeC. For the bulk priming treatment, the intermittent spraying
   method of recycled solution was designed and compared with the constant
   air bubbling into solution and the filter paper treatment in petri-dish.
   The priming treatment was very effective to decreasing the time taken
   for germination in petri-dish and seedling emergence on peatmoss media.
   The best conditions for the germination of hot pepper were for 5 days in
   0.2M KNO3 at 20degreeC and 20 days in 0.2M KH2PO4 at 15degreeC. Compared
   to 23.3% of no-primed seeds, the germination rate of primed seeds was
   above 95% at 20degreeC of sub-optimal temperature in petri-dish.
   Germination of dried-back seeds following priming was better at
   25degreeC of drying condition than at 15 and 20degreeC, and was delayed
   by about one day, but there was no difference in final germination rate
   as compared to primed seeds not dried back. Intermittent spraying of
   recycled solution showed the same result with the filter paper priming
   treatment, but was more effective for priming of hot pepper seeds than
   constant air bubbling into solution.

AB Chinese milk vetch (A. sinicus) is a biennial leguminous plant. Although
   this species is becoming a common green manure crop, Chinese milk vetch
   seed has a low germination rate due to low water permeability of the
   seed coat which is a limiting factor in sowing and international seed
   trading. A method of improving seed coat permeability was determined.
   Stored seed germination rate was evaluated every 20 days from 40 days of
   harvest. Chinese milk vetch seeds were stored at cold (5°C) and warm
   (30, 35 and 40°C) temperatures, and stratifications were carried out for
   20, 40 and 60 days. The data collected for seeds stored at room
   temperature were used as the controls. In seeds stored at room
   temperature, dormancy was broken gradually. However, a dramatic increase
   in germination 20 days after imbibition occurred 80 days after harvest,
   a season coincident with early September, the optimum sowing interval.
   Also, inhibition of germination was observed 10 days after seed
   imbibition 160-200 days after harvest which is consistent with the
   November-December interval. Heat drying for 20 days induced the breaking
   of dormancy of the seeds. This was not observed in seeds that were heat
   dried for 40 and 60 days. Cold treatment for 40 and 60 days induced
   dormancy in the seeds. Dormancy was broken by stratification at 30, 35
   and 40°C for 20, 40 and 60 days, with germination rates varying from 40
   to 92%.

AB Red pepper, one of the major economic crops in Korea, is being affected
   by anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum acutatum. To control
   this disease, an antagonistic bacterial strain, Bacillus subtilis YGB36
   identified by 16S rDNA sequencing, physiological and biochemical
   analyses is used as a biological control agent. In vitro screening
   revealed that the strain YGB36 possess strong antifungal activity
   against the pathogen Cylindrocarpon destructans. The strain exhibited
   cellulase, protease, amylase, siderophore production and phosphate
   solubility. In vitro conidial germination of C. acutatum was most
   drastically inhibited by YGB36 cell suspensions (106 cfu/ml) or culture
   filtrate. Development of anthracnose symptoms was reduced on detached
   immature green pepper fruits by treatment with cell suspensions, and its
   control value was recorded as 65.7%. The YGB36 bacterial suspension
   treatment enhanced the germination rate of red pepper seeds and promoted
   root development and growth under greenhouse conditions. The in vitro
   screening of fungicide and insecticide sensitivity test against YGB36
   revealed that the bacterial growth was not affected by any of the
   insecticides, and 11 fungicides out of 21 used. Collectively, our
   results clearly suggest that the strain YGB36 is considered as one of
   the potential biocontrol agents against anthracnose disease in red
   pepper.

AB The changes of dormancy and vigor during natural overwintering and
   during simultaneous dry storage were studied using Norway spruce (Picea
   abies (L.) Karat.) seeds from individual trees. Dormancy was evaluated
   by studying germination response to light and moist chilling at 12 and
   21 degrees C. A dormancy reducing germination at 12 degrees C in
   darkness was induced in seed during overwintering and during 5 months of
   storage at 6% moisture content and 5 degrees C. Light released that
   dormancy effectively. Moist chilling was unable to substitute for Light
   in most seeds. Simultaneously with induction of light requirement, the
   seeds ripened during overwintering (either via dormancy relief or
   invigoration), as indicted by the increased germination rate at 12
   degrees C in light and by the disappearance of the negative chilling
   effects. Moist chilling decreased germination time as much or more in
   seeds collected in winter than in autumn-collected seeds, in which the
   chilling effect was small or negative. No evidence on dry afterripening
   in storage was found. According to leachate conductivity and accelerated
   aging tests, the effect of overwintering on seed vigor was either
   insignificant or negative. The results are useful in developing proper
   pretreatment and management procedures for seeds used for seedling
   production or direct seeding.

AB Common waterhemp is an obligate outcrosser that has high genetic
   variability. How. ever, under selection pressure, this weed shows
   population differentiation for adaptive traits. Intraspecific variation
   for herbicide resistance has been studied, but no studies have been
   conducted to determine the existence of variation for other adaptive
   traits that could influence weed management. The objective of this study
   was to examine the existence of different seed dormancy regulatory
   mechanisms in common waterhemp. Seed dormancy regulation, in response to
   different temperature and moisture regimes, was studied through
   germination experiments and proteome analysis using two common waterhemp
   biotypes (Ames and Everly) collected from agricultural fields in Iowa,
   and one biotype (Ohio) collected from a pristine area in Ohio. Without
   stratification, germination percentage among the different biorypes was
   9, 29 and 88% for Ames, Everly, and Ohio respectively. The germination
   rate of seeds.. from Ames was dramatically increased after incubation at
   either 4 or 25 C under wet conditions, whereas germination of seeds from
   Everly was only increased at 25, C under wet conditions. The Ohio
   biotype showed no change in germination response to any of the
   incubation treatments. Germination studies indicated that the rate of
   seed dormancy alleviation differed between biorypes. Seed protein
   profiles obtained from the three biorypes differed in protein abundance,
   number, and type. A putative small heat-shock protein (sHSP) of 17.6 kDa
   and isoelectric point (pI) 6.1 increased whereas a putative
   glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) of 30.9 kDa and pI 6.4
   decreased in abundance in the Ames biotype as seed dormancy was reduced
   in response to incubation at 4 C and wet conditions. These two proteins
   did not change in the Everly and Ohio biotypes, suggesting that these
   proteins changed their abundance in response to seed dormancy
   alleviation. The results of this study suggest that differences in seed
   dormancy levels between the biorypes were due to different physiological
   regulatory mechanisms.

AB Seed dispersal, germination and seedling establishment are affected by
   various ecological factors in desert plant species. Tamarix ramosissima
   has evolved multiple strategies to facilitate its survival in harsh
   environments during the early stages of development. In this study, we
   investigated the effects of different ecological factors on seed
   germination and seedling growth, the function of the seed pappus in seed
   dispersal, as well as the function of the hypocotyl hairs in seedling
   establishment. We found that the seed germination of T. ramosissima was
   rapid and could occur under a wide range of temperatures (5-30 degrees
   C), after long periods of storage (at least 12 months on dispersal),
   under high concentrations of salts (700-900 mmol.L-1) and polyethylene
   glycol (PEG) 6000 (500 g.L-1) and under medium concentrations of alkalis
   (300-500 mmol.L-1). Lower concentrations of salts and PEG promoted
   seedling growth. The seed pappus had no effect on seed germination, but
   it might function as an accessory structure that provides a buoyancy
   force and promotes long-distance seed dispersal. The hypocotyl hairs
   located on the edge of the hypocotyl end might aid the upright
   positioning of the seedlings during early development, especially when
   seed germination occurs under floating or flooding conditions. In
   conclusion, the germination of T. ramosissima seeds and seedling
   development can occur under diverse types of abiotic stress, and the
   seed pappus and hypocotyl hairs played an important role in seed
   dispersal and seedling establishment.

   using GC-MS; capacities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT)
   and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were individually increased by

   old seedling and adaptability of, Cornus amomum, C. oblique, C.
   racemosa, C. drumondii, C. florida, C. sanguinea and C. walteri, were
   studied by test. Results showed that seed dormancy of six alien trees
   were basically broken after 360 days' low temperature sand treatment,
   and their seed germination rate ranged 82%-93%, with that of C. walteri
   (native) 45%, as its seed oil content was high even though seeds went
   through the same process. The seeds by cold stratification generally
   began budding in late February, germinated epigenlly in succession by
   late March, lasting for a long continuative time. The high growth of one
   year old seedling of C. sanguinea was maximum (94.13 cm), C. drumondii
   ranked as the second (93.75 cm), with that of C. racemosa, C. walteri,
   C. amomum and C. oblique medium. And that of C. florida (41.30 cm) was
   the least. The growth patterns of C. amomum, C. oblique, C. racemosa, C.
   drumondii, C. sanguinea and C. walteri, featured as obvious S-curve, but
   that of C. florida was not evident. All of 7 species of trees showed
   strong resistance or tolerance to environmental stress, and therefore
   had wide prospects of application.

AB Chilling tolerance was increased in seed germination and root growth of
   wheat seedlings grown in media containing 20 mu g/mL cerebroside C (CC),
   isolated from the endophytic Phyllosticta sp. TG78. Seeds treated with
   20 mu g/mL CC at 4 degrees C expressed the higher germination rate
   (77.78%), potential (23.46%), index (3.44) and the shorter germination
   time (6.19 d); root growth was also significantly improved by 13.76% in
   length, 13.44% in fresh weight and 6.88% in dry mass compared to
   controls. During the cultivation process at 4 degrees C for three days
   and the followed 24 h at 25 degrees C, lipid peroxidation, expressed by
   malondialdehyde (MDA) content and relative membrane permeability (RMP)
   was significantly reduced in CC-treated roots; activities of
   lipoxygenase (LOX), phospholipid C (PLC) and phospholipid D (PLD) were
   inhibited by 13.62-62.26%, 13.54-63.93% and 13.90-61.17%, respectively;
   unsaturation degree of fatty acids was enhanced through detecting the
   contents of CC-induced linoleic acid, linolenic acid, palmitic acid and
   stearic acid using GC-MS; capacities of superoxide dismutase (SOD),
   catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were individually
   increased by 7.69-46.06%, 3.37-37.96%, and 27.00-178.07%. These results
   suggest that increased chilling tolerance may be due, in part, to the
   reduction of lipid peroxidation and alternation of lipid composition of
   roots in the presence of CC.

AB Sparkleberry (Vaccinium arboreum), a native species, has the potential
   as a blueberry rootstock due to its broader adaptation and less yield
   loss during mechanical harvesting. However, propagating sparkleberry on
   a large scale is difficult and little information about its seed
   germination can be found. To improve sparkleberry germination rate, a
   germination study was conducted with seeds collected in November and
   December 2018. Seeds were treated with gibberellic acid (GA(3)) at three
   levels (0, 500, and 1,000 mg L-1) and cold stratification at four levels
   (0, 3, 6, and 9 weeks). Emergence percentage (EP), emergence index (EI),
   and the number of days needed for the first seed to emerge (NDE) were
   recorded and calculated. Results showed that the combination of GA(3)
   and cold stratification could increase V. arboreum EP, while in the
   control (no GA(3) or cold stratification) no seeds germinated by the end
   of the experiment. Seeds collected from November treated with 500 mg L-1
   GA(3) and 9-week cold stratification reached an EP at 70.4% with 12.6
   DNE. Seeds collected from December treated with 1,000 mg L-1 GA(3) and
   3-week cold stratification reached an EP at 61.2% with 19 DNE. In
   conclusion, applying GA(3) at 500 mg L-1 or 1,000 mg L-1 combined with
   weeks of cold stratification can be used to improve V. arboreum seed
   germination.

AB The Black-fruit Berberis seeds of Huocheng population, Xinyuan
   population, Tekesi population and the Red-fruit Berberis of Tekesi
   population were used as experimental materials to study their biological
   characteristics, water absorption characteristics and the effects of
   seed coat removal, low temperature stratification and different
   concentrations of GA(3) treatment on the dormancy and germination
   characteristics. The results showed that; (1) The water absorption rate
   of four groups of wild Berberis seeds showed a trend of increasing
   gradually. There was no significant difference in water absorption
   between Black -fruit Berberis seeds and Red -fruit Berberis seeds, and
   the water permeability of their seed coat was similar; (2) The seed
   coats of Black -fruit Berberis seeds of Huocheng population, Xinyuan
   population and Tekesi population had a strong inhibitory effect on
   germination. However the seed coat of Red -fruit Berberis seeds in
   Tekesi population had no obvious inhibition on germination; (3) Low
   temperature stratification had a great effect on the germination of wild
   Berberis seeds in 4 groups, and the germination rate of Berberis seeds
   increased gradually with the increase of stratification time. The
   dormancy of Black-fruit Berberis seeds was basically relieved after 90
   days of stratification; the dormancy of Red-fruit Berberis seeds was
   basically relieved after 30 days of stratification; (4) GA(3) solution
   with 200 mg . L-1 concentration could significantly increase the
   germination rate of the four groups Berberis seeds, and too high or too
   low concentration could inhibit the germination of Berberis seeds. After
   60 days of layering,the germination rates of Black-fruit Berberis seeds
   without seed coat of Huocheng population, Xinyuan population and Tekesi
   population were 85.00%, 83.33%, and 86.67% respectively after treated
   with GA3 solution of 200 mg . L-1 for 2 hours; When the Red-fruit
   Berberis seeds were layered for 15 days, the germination rates of
   Red-fruit Berberis seeds without seed coat of Tekesi population were 86.
   67% after treated with GA3 solution of 200 mg . L-1 for 2 hours. The
   results will provide technical support and scientific basis for the
   introduction and breeding of wild Berberis.

AB Rice Maxiangu with stronger cold-resistance to low temperature stress
   has higher adaptive ability than that of Guichao with weaker

   leakage, root growth, vigor index and mean germination days during seed
   germination in Maxiangu were less than in Guichao. After the seedlings
   treated low temperature the sensitivities of root conductivity,
   eitolated seedlings, chlorophyll fluorescence of leaves in Maxiangu were
   also less-sensitive than in Guichao. The changes of these physiological
   characteristics are consistent with the survival rate of seedlings. The
   above-mentioned changes could be considered as the index of cold
   tolerance of rice varieties. The cold tolerance of three rice(F1) hybrid
   and their parents was analysed. Results indicate that the effect of root
   conductivity, chlorophyll fluorescence of leaves and survival rate of
   seedlings at low temperature was able to reflect the cold-resistance
   level between hybrid rice (F1) and their parents to a certain extent.
   The cold tolerance of hybrid rice (F1) was similar to the maternal line.
   Appraising the methods of cold-resistance of rice seedlings is

   centralasiatica under saline conditions was investigated. Cold
   stratification increased the germination rate, but did not affect final
   germination percentage of either brown or black seeds. Seed coat
   scarification and fluridone (Abscisic acid [ABA] biosynthesis inhibitor)
   improved germination of both types of seeds under salinity stress. In
   both brown and black seeds. gibberellin,
   1-aminocy-cloproane-1-carboxylate (the immediate precursor of ethylene)
   and 6-benzyladenine, had little effect on the germination under
   salinity. Paclobutrazol (inhibitor of gibberellin biosynthesis) and ABA
   did not affect germination in distilled water, whereas ABA inhibited
   germination in saline conditions for both types of seeds. Paclobutrazol
   inhibited the germination of black seed only under salinity. Black seeds
   were more sensitive to ABA than brown seeds in salinity stress. Brown
   seeds contained more active gibberellins than black seeds, although they
   contained a similar level of ABA. In conclusion, the production of black
   and brown seeds showed bet-hedging ecological strategies. Gibberellins
   in seeds and ABA in seeds and bracteoles were the main plant hormones
   that affected the germination of dimorphic seeds.

AB Chilling depresses seed germination and seedling establishment, and is
   one major constraint to grain yield formation in late sown winter wheat.
   Seeds of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were separately pre-soaked
   with sodium nitroprusside (SNP, as nitric oxide donor) and Gibberellic
   acid (GA(3)) before germination and then germinated under low
   temperature. SNP and GA(3) pre-treatment increased seed germination
   rate, germination index, weights and lengths of coleoptile and radicle,
   while they decreased mean germination time and weight of seeds
   germinating under low temperature. Exogenous NO and GA(3) increased seed
   respiration rate and promoted starch degradation along with increased
   amylase activities. In addition, efficient antioxidant systems were
   activated by NO, and which effectively reduced concentrations of
   malondialdehyde and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Seedling growth was also
   enhanced by exogenous NO and GA(3) as a result of improved seed
   germination and maintenance of better reactive oxygen species
   homeostasis in seedling growing under chilling temperatures. It is
   indicated that exogenous NO was more effective than GA(3) in alleviating
   chilling stress during seed germination and seedling establishment in
   wheat.

   (RSS), room dry storage (RDS), cold stratification (CSF). The
   characteristics of seed germination and seedling growth status were
   studied. The results showed: (1) there were 65.37% of seeds mildewed by
   CSF for 30 days, and the germination rate was 30.93% in the last; The
   germination rate was 35.67% by FSW for 90 days. (2) The germination rate
   of CSS, CDS, RSS and RDS were significantly higher than fresh seeds
   (26.37%) (P<0.05), and CDS under 4°C for 90 days got the highest
   germination rate (70.65%), with the coefficient of germination rate was
   1 956.97. (3) Compared with fresh seeds, the contents of starch and
   protein of seeds by CDS for 90 days decreased by 38.75% and 20.16%,
   respectively, while content of total soluble sugar increased by 31.47%.
   Contents of starch, protein and total soluble sugar of seeds by FSW for
   90 days significantly decreased by 48.75%, 62.62% and 6.29%,
   respectively. (4) The seedling growth status showed significant
   difference (P<0.05) between different storage methods after 90 days, and
   the CDS got the highest seedling vigor index, while the seedling vigor
   index of FSW was significantly lower than that of other storage methods
   after seed germinated. The results showed that seed germination rate and
   seedling vigor index of D. chinense under low temperature condition were
   significantly higher than that of room temperature. The possible reasons
   were that the storage substance of seed is hydrolyzed with the protein
   content decreased and the soluble sugar content increased under
   low-temperature storage condition, which is more favorable for seed
   absorption of soluble sugar and provides energy for seed germination, so
   as to accelerate the process of the breaking seed physiological
   dormancy. In addition, D. chinense seeds possessed a certain tolerance
   to the submergence. Therefore, D. chinense can be considered prior
   species in the restoration and reconstruction of vegetation in the high
   elevation area in the riparian zone of the Three Gorges Reservoir.

AB BackgroundSheepgrass (Leymus chinensis (Trin.) Tzvel) is a perennial
   forage grass that can survive extreme freezing winters (-47.5 degrees C)
   in China. In this study, we isolated an unknown function MYB
   transcription factor gene, LcMYB4, from sheepgrass. However, the
   function of LcMYB4 and its homologous genes has not been studied in
   other plants.ResultsThe expression of the LcMYB4 gene was upregulated in
   response to cold induction, and the LcMYB4 fusion protein was localized
   in the nucleus, with transcriptional activation activity. Biological
   function analysis showed that compared with WT plants,
   LcMYB4-overexpressing Arabidopsis presented significantly increased
   chilling and freezing tolerance as evidenced by increased germination
   rate, survival rate, and seed setting rate under conditions of low
   temperature stress. Furthermore, LcMYB4-overexpressing plants showed
   increased soluble sugar content, leaf chlorophyll content and superoxide
   dismutase activity but decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) under chilling
   stress. Moreover, the expression of the CBF1, KIN1, KIN2 and RCI2A genes
   were significantly upregulated in transgenic plants with chilling
   treatment. These results suggest that LcMYB4 overexpression increased
   the soluble sugar content and cold-inducible gene expression and
   alleviated oxidative damage and membrane damage, resulting in enhanced
   cold resistance in transgenic plants. Interestingly, our results showed
   that the LcMYB4 protein interacts with fructose-1,6-bisphosphate
   aldolase protein1 (LcFBA1) and that the expression of the LcFBA1 gene
   was also upregulated during cold induction in sheepgrass, similar to
   LcMYB4.ConclusionOur findings suggest that LcMYB4 encodes MYB
   transcription factor that plays a positive regulatory role in cold
   stress.

AB Pregermination stratification treatment was generally more important
   than the effects of light on seed germination by 14 conifer species and
   varieties native to British Columbia. Nevertheless, there were some
   strong species differences in the response of germination to light.
   Final germination percentage after 21 days (28 days for Abies spp.) for
   both stratified and unstratified seeds of Picea glauca, Picea
   sitchensis, and Tsuga heterophylla showed no response to light during
   germination. Seed germination by Abies grandis, Pinus contorta var.
   contorta, Pinus contorta var. latifolia, Pinus ponderosa, Pseudotsuga
   menziesii var. glauca, and Pseudotsuga menziesii var. menziesii
   responded positively to light if unstratified but was not significantly
   affected by light when stratified. For Thuja plicata seeds, germination
   responded positively to light regardless of stratification pretreatment.
   Light appeared to reduce germination of stratified seeds of Abies
   amabilis, Abies lasiocarpa, Larix occidentalis, and Pinus monticola,
   although stratification conditions for these species were suboptimal.
   The germination rate of stratified seeds of all species and unstratified
   seeds of most species was increased by light. Results showed no
   significant relationship between germination response to light and
   shade-tolerance ranking or mean seed weight of the species. In six seed
   lots of Pinus contorta var. latifolia, however, we detected st weak
   negative correlation between mean seed weight and unstratified light
   responsivity measured after 1 week but a significant positive
   correlation when measured after 3 weeks. Very low light levels in
   closed-canopy forests or in the forest floor may prolong tree seed
   germination but are unlikely to constrain final germination levels after
   most seeds have been naturally stratified by moist, cool winter
   conditions. The importance of differences in the rate and timing of tree
   seed germination under natural conditions remains to be demonstrated.

AB In this paper, we studied seed dormant reasons of Hovenia acerba Lindl.
   based on the observations on the structure and permeability of seed coat
   and the seed embryo growth. In order to find out an effective way to
   overcome seed dormancy, the seeds were treated by cold stratification at
   3-5°C, acid scarification, and mechanical scarification. The results
   showed that the low seed coat permeability was the main reasons of seed
   dormancy, and which was a type of physical dormancy (PY). 72% seeds
   germinated when exposure to cold stratification at 3-5°C for 75 days,
   and 76% seeds germinated when exposure to cold stratification for 90
   days and germinated more quickly. Soaking with sulfuric acid for 5 to 25
   minutes promoted seed germination rate to 76%-81%. There were no obvious
   differences in germination rate among these ways of breaking the
   dormancy. However, there was a significant seed damage when exposure to
   acid scarification over 30 minutes, because the seed germination rate
   was only 64%. The seed started to sprout at the 4th day after parts of
   seed coat were removed, the germination rate reached to over 80%, this
   germination speed was the same as that of treating with cold
   stratification for 90 days. On the other hand, when the surface of seeds
   bruised, the seeds started to sprout on the 6th day and the germination
   rate was 73%.

   FACTORS (TCP) transcription factors have versatile functions in plant
   growth, development and response to environmental stress. Despite
   blueberrys value as an important fruit crop, the TCP gene family has not
   been systematically studied in this plant. The current study identified
   blueberry TCP genes (VcTCPs) using genomic data from the tetraploid
   blueberry variety Draper; a total of 62 genes were obtained. Using
   multiple sequence alignment, conserved motif, and gene structure
   analyses, family members were divided into two subfamilies, of which
   class II was further divided into two subclasses, CIN and TB1. Synteny
   analysis showed that genome-wide or segment-based replication played an
   important role in the expansion of the blueberry TCP gene family. The
   expression patterns of VcTCP genes during fruit development, flower bud
   dormancy release, hormone treatment, and tissue-specific expression were
   analyzed using RNA-seq and qRT-PCR. The results showed that the TB1
   subclass members exhibited a certain level of expression in the shoot,
   leaf, and bud; these genes were not expressed during fruit development,
   but transcript levels decreased uniformly during the release of flower
   bud dormancy by low-temperature accumulation. The further transgenic
   experiments showed the overexpression of VcTCP18in Arabidopsis
   significantly decreased the seed germination rate in contrast to the
   wild type. The bud dormancy phenomena as late-flowering, fewer rosettes
   and main branches were also observed in transgenic plants. Overall, this
   study provides the first insight into the evolution, expression, and
   function of VcTCP genes, including the discovery that VcTCP18 negatively
   regulated bud dormancy release in blueberry. The results will deepen our
   understanding of the function of TCPs in plant growth and development.

AB Chilling stress is an important constraint for maize seedling
   establishment in the field. To examine the role of salicylic acid (SA)
   and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in response to chilling stress, we
   investigated the effects of seed priming with SA, H2O2, and SA + H2O2
   combination on maize resistance under chilling stress (13 degrees C).
   Priming with SA, H2O2, and especially SA + H2O2 shortened seed
   germination time and enhanced seed vigor and seedling growth as compared
   with hydropriming and non-priming treatments under low temperature.
   Meanwhile, SA + H2O2 priming notably increased the endogenous H2O2 and
   SA content, antioxidant enzymes activities and their corresponding genes
   ZmPAL, ZmSOD4, ZmAPX2, ZmCAT2, and ZmGR expression levels. The
   alpha-amylase activity was enhanced to mobilize starch to supply
   metabolites such as soluble sugar and energy for seed germination under
   chilling stress. In addition, the SA + H2O2 combination positively
   up-regulated expressions of gibberellic acid (GA) biosynthesis genes
   ZmGA20ox1 and ZmGA3ox2, and down-regulated GA catabolism gene ZmGA2ox1
   expression; while it promoted GA signaling transduction genes
   expressions of ZmGID1 and ZmGID2 and decreased the level of seed
   germination inhibitor gene ZmRGL2. The abscisic acid (ABA) catabolism
   gene ZmCYP707A2 and the expressions of ZmCPK11 and ZmSnRK2.1 encoding
   response receptors in ABA signaling pathway were all up-regulated. These
   results strongly suggested that priming with SA and H2O2 synergistically
   promoted hormones metabolism and signal transduction, and enhanced
   energy supply and antioxidant enzymes activities under chilling stress,
   which were closely relevant with chilling injury alleviation and
   chillingtolerance improvement in maize seed.

   with changing temperatures of day and night (20°C/10°C, day/night)-cold
   (4°C), warm (20°C)-cold (4°C), cold (10°C)-cold (4°C). The results
   showed that the length and width of embryos treated for 6 months
   increased from 1.52 and 0.47 mm to 1.95 and 0.61 mm respectively. The
   content of soluble sugar increased to 46.3 mg/g, but crude fat decreased
   by 3.8%. Dehydrogenase activity (TTC) at 10 months was 2 times as high
   as that before treatment. The activity of glucose-6-phosphate
   dehydrogenas (G-6-PDH) decreased at anterior phase but increased at
   latter phase. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content was steady with a low
   level at the first phase, but remarkably increased at the second phase,
   3.9 times higher than the initial value. The percentage of breached
   seeds and germination rate of changed temperature-cold stratification
   were 11.4% and 14.7% respectively, and significantly higher than that of
   warm-cold and cold-cold stratification. It is shown that the changing
   temperature of day and night-cold stratification was more effective in
   breaking seed dormancy than warm-cold and cold-cold stratification.

AB In South Korea, Pinus pumila (Pall.) Regel (dwarf stone pine) has been
   designated as a critically endangered species by the Korea Forest
   Service. We have difficulties in obtaining the seeds of P. pumila
   because P. pumila grows only in the Daecheongbong area (1550–1700 m
   above sea level) of Mt. Seorak and almost all of its cones are damaged
   by birds and rodents. For establishing an ex situ conservation stand of
   P. pumila, this study was conducted to figure out the effects of wet
   cold (cold stratification, prechilling) and GA3 treatment on the
   germination of P. pumila seeds. After cold stratification (1, 2, 3, 4, 5
   months), prechilling (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 months) and GA3 treatment (0, 100,
   500, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 ㎎/L), seeds were placed on petri-dishes at 25℃
   under light condition. The percentage of germination, mean germination
   time and the germination rate were investigated. The results showed that
   both of the cold stratification and prechilling were effective in
   improving germination performances. However, there were no significant
   differences in performances between the two cold treatments. Within each
   treatment, the germination performances improved with the period of
   treatment. However, after three months of treatment, the performances
   showed no significant improvement. The gibberellin treatment was also
   effective in improving seed germination of P. pumila. The percentage of
   germination reached 79.0% in the seeds treated with 100 ㎎/L of GA3.
   However, the germination performances decreased at high concentration of
   GA3 treatments (over 2000 ㎎/L). In conclusion, cold stratification (over
   3 months) or 100 ㎎/L of GA3 treatment was considered to be the
   appropriate method for seedling production of P. pumila.

   French. The number of seeds produced by a single plant ranged from 88 to
   1058. The germinability of seeds stored for 3 months at room temperature
   after harvest was almost zero and it was not improved by different
   temperature, light and GA3 treatments. However, after 27 months at room
   temperature it rose to 47.5%. Removal or pinpricking of the seed coat
   were effective in breaking dormancy, giving germination rates of 86.8
   and 82.3%, respectively. Stratification was also effective in breaking
   dormancy; whole dormant seeds incubated for 70 days at 2.5°C on wet
   cottonwool showed a germination rate of >85%.

AB Flame azalea (Rhododendron calendulaceum), a species endemic to the
   Appalachian mountain region of the Eastern U.S., is a species of
   horticultural and ecological significance. In the wild, this species
   exhibits a high degree of inter- and intra-population variation in
   morphological and physiological characteristics. Inherent differences
   among populations suggest that variations in germination behavior may
   exist in wild collected seeds. Investigation of the seed and site
   specific characteristics separating existing populations can potentially
   lead to an identification of a particular native seed source suitable
   for widespread propagation, and aid in the development of ecological
   preservation protocols. Our objectives were twofold: (1) investigate
   seed morphology differences in the studied populations, and (2) conduct
   standard germination studies, including cold stratification, and
   identify variation in germination characteristics between populations.
   Flame azalea seeds used in this study were collected from five
   populations located in North Carolina. Variations in overall seed and
   embryo parameters within and among the populations were identified.
   Significant differences in germination percentages existed between
   collections, with values ranging from 42.2% to 73.0% in non-stratified
   seeds, and 50.9% to 65.3% in seeds subjected to cold moist
   stratification. Significant differences existed between T1, T50, and
   T10-90 values among populations. Seed perimeter measurements were
   positively correlated with germination percentage (r2=0.84, P=0.029).
   However, no other statistically significant correlations between seed
   size parameters and germination traits were detected. Cold moist
   stratification showed no significant improvement of overall germination
   percentages in the sources tested, but did behave differently in the
   rate and uniformity of germination in comparison to non-stratified
   seeds. Our findings demonstrate varying seed size parameters, and
   germination behavior specific to each seed population.

AB Ryegrass is considered a useful grass species for forage production and
   turf purposes. Annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) and perennial
   ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) are two species of ryegrass with similar
   genomes. So far, little information exists concerning their
   physiological response to salt-alkali stress during germination stage,
   especially under different temperature regimes. Seeds of ryegrass were
   germinated at four alternating temperatures (10-20, 15-25, 20-30, and
   25-35 degrees C) with salinity (NaCl) and alkalinity (Na2CO3, high pH)
   stresses. Results showed that optimal germination for both species under
   stress conditions occurred at higher temperatures (20-30 degrees C for
   annual ryegrass; 20-30 degrees C and 25-35 degrees C for perennial
   ryegrass). Germination percentage and germination rate were both
   inhibited by increasing salinity or alkalinity, particularly higher
   alkalinities under any temperature. The inhibitory effects of the high
   salinity on germination were greater at 10-20 degrees C for both
   species. However, seeds were subjected to more stress at 25-35 degrees C
   under alkali stress even though the concentration was very low. In
   addition, both high and low temperatures lead to a markedly decrease in
   seed germination under alkali stress for perennial ryegrass. Recovery
   percentage of both species were highest at 400 mM salinity and 25 mM
   alkalinity under any temperature, especially 10-20 degrees C, and 25-35
   degrees C also resulted in lower recovery percentages under both
   stresses for ryegrass. Moreover, annual ryegrass had a much higher
   recovery percentage than perennial ryegrass under such stress
   conditions. These results suggest that salinity stress and alkalinity
   stress are greatly different, and the salt-alkaline tolerance of
   ryegrass seeds is greatly affected by the interactions of temperature
   and salinity-alkalinity.

AB Seeds of Michelia compressa were collected from Nanjung, Chilan and
   Shiauhyi in 1993. Moisture contents of 13.6% +- 1.5%, 11.5% +- 1.2%,
   7.8% +- 1.5%, 6.3% +- 1.3% and 4.7% +- 1.3% ( fresh weight basis ) were
   maintained for seeds dry stored at 94% rh., 75% rh., 40% rh., 35% rh.,
   and 14% rh., respectively. Fresh mature seeds were characterized by
   dormancy which prevailed over the dry storage condition. With an
   18-month storage period, it was found that at a constant storage
   temperature, germination was better maintained at a lower moisture
   content. At relative humidities of 35%-40%, longevity was better
   maintained at a lower storage temperature. Seed germinability could be
   kept for at least 18 months at moisture contents of 6.3% or less and at
   -20 degree C. Seeds of M. compressa were also characterized with high
   deterioration rates at high storage temperatures; at a moisture content
   of 15% and 15 degree C, seeds lost 80% to 100% of their germinability
   within 4 month of storage. Cold and wet storage kept the germinability
   at least for 1 year. In addition to breaking dormancy, cold wet storage
   could reduce the time of reaching 50% of the final germination ( G-50 )
   to 2 weeks after the seeds were stored for half a year. Dry storage only
   slightly reduced G-50). After ripening of mature M. compressa seeds
   occurred extremely fast in the first week of dry storage, and at 25
   degree C the seeds had a higher germination rate and lower G-50 than at
   5 degree C. On a longer time scale, after-ripening was less obvious at a
   seed moisture content around 12% or when the seeds were equilibrated to
   a relative humidity of 75%. M. compressa seeds stored at 94% relative
   humidity, had much higher germination rates than those stored at 75%
   relative humidity in the first several months of storage; also seeds
   stored at 94% relative humidity had significantly lower G-50s than those
   stored at the other 3 relative humidities. It is considered that this
   phenomenon mimics the effect of stratification.

AB Objective: The germination and some chilling injury related with
   physio-biochemical indices of cassava were studied in order to forecast
   for application of control measures, and to evaluate the varieties
   tolerance to cold temperature. Method: Three cassava varieties, viz.,
   Guire 3, Huanan 124 and Huanan 205 were treated with different low
   temperatures (2, 5 and 8°C) for 0 (CK), 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 d,
   respectively, in three replicates. The germination rate and some
   physio-biochemical indices such as relative conductivity and proline
   content, etc., were determined. Result: Under the similar temperature
   conditions, the variety Huanan 124 showed maximum germination rate
   followed by the varieties Huanan 205 and Guire 3. However, the relative
   conductivity of Guire 3 increased sharply, compared to Huanan 124, which
   was comparatively slower at the early stage of the treatment. The
   relative conductivity of Hunan 205 treated for 6 d at 2°C was over 6%.
   The proline content of Guire 3, Huanan 205 and Huanan 124 were found
   more than 80.0% in the treatments of 4, 6 and 12 d, respectively, at 2°C
   temperature. Conclusion: The relative conductivity and proline content
   may be used as physio-biochemical markers for evaluating cassava
   varieties against low temperature.

AB Seed germination requirements may determine the kinds of habitat in

   addition can change seed germination trait-environmental filter
   interactions and ultimately redistribute seed germination traits in
   alpine meadows. We determined the role of N addition on germination
   trait selection in an alpine meadow after N addition by combining a
   3-year N addition experiment in an alpine meadow and laboratory
   germination experiments. At the species level, germination percentage,
   germination rate (speed) and breadth of temperature niche for
   germination (BTN) were positively related to survival of a species in
   the fertilized community. In addition, community-weighted means of
   germination percentage, germination rate, germination response to
   alternating temperature and BTN increased. However, germination response
   to wet-cold storage (cold stratification) and functional richness of
   germination traits was lower in alpine meadows with high-nitrogen
   addition than in those with no, low and medium N addition. Thus, N
   addition had a significant influence on environmental filter-germination
   trait interactions and generated a different set of germination traits
   in the alpine meadow. Further, the effect of N addition on germination
   trait selection by environmental filters was amount-dependent. Low and

AB Gaura parviflora is native to the North America, but it has now become
   one of the main exotic invasive plants in China. Through field
   investigations and the seed germination experiments in the laboratory,
   the biomass structure traits, the correlation models among different
   modules, the reproductive allocation and the seed germination traits of
   G. parviflora population were studied. The results showed that: (1) The
   biomass of root, stem, leaf and capitulum (and fruit) of G. parviflora
   had remarkable positive correlations with plant height, and the biomass
   of each module also had remarkable positive correlation, which could be
   described respectively by power function or linear function; (2) The
   biomass proportion of each module to the whole plant decreased in the
   sequence of stem, capitulum (and fruit), leaf, root; (3) The
   reproducetive investment and reproductive allocation increased as the
   individual size increased; (4) A linear function relationship was found
   between the individual size and reproductive investment whereas a power
   function relationship between the individual size and reproductive
   allocation was detected; (5) Reproductive threshold in this plant was
   comparably small (0.6043 g); (6) The seed of G. parviflora was
   non-photoblastic. Its seed germination percentage was more than 85% both
   under 12 h light or continuous dark condition. The seed germination rate
   reached 79% and 92.5% respectively in seeds stored for 45 d at ambient
   temperature (14-32°C) and seeds stored for 45 d at cold stratification
   (1-2°C) while the seed germination did not occur without being stored.
   In the natural habitat in Luoyang, seedling of G. parviflora emerge
   almost during the growing season, even in the early winter. It was
   concluded that the traits of module biomass structure and reproductive
   allocation, seed germination all facilitated its invasions.

AB Plant germination ecology involves continuous interactions between
   changing environmental conditions and the sensitivity of seed
   populations to respond to those conditions at a given time. Ecologically
   meaningful parameters characterizing germination capacity (or dormancy)
   are needed to advance our understanding of the evolution of germination
   strategies within plant communities. The germination traits commonly
   examined (e.g., maximum germination percentage under optimal conditions)
   may not adequately reflect the critical ecological differences in
   germination behavior across species, communities, and seasons. In
   particular, most seeds exhibit primary dormancy at dispersal that is
   alleviated by exposure to dry after-ripening or to hydrated chilling to
   enable germination in a subsequent favorable season. Population-based
   threshold (PBT) models of seed germination enable quantification of
   patterns of germination timing using parameters based on mechanistic
   assumptions about the underlying germination physiology. We applied the
   hydrothermal time (HTT) model, a type of PBT model that integrates
   environmental temperature and water availability, to study germination
   physiology in a guild of coexisting desert annual species whose seeds
   were after-ripened by dry storage under different conditions. We show
   that HTT assumptions are valid for describing germination physiology in
   these species, including loss of dormancy during after-ripening. Key HTT
   parameters, the hydrothermal time constant (theta(HT)) and base water
   potential distribution among seeds (psi(b)(g)), were effective in
   describing changes in dormancy states and in clustering species
   exhibiting similar germination syndromes. theta(HT) is an inherent
   species-specific trait relating to timing of germination that correlates
   well with long-term field germination fraction, while psi(b)(g) shifts
   with depth of dormancy in response to after-ripening and seasonal
   environmental variation. Predictions based on variation among coexisting
   species in theta(HT) and psi(b)(g) in laboratory germination tests
   matched well with 25-yr observations of germination dates and fractions
   for the same species in natural field conditions. Seed dormancy and
   germination strategies, which are significant contributors to long-term
   species demographics under natural conditions, can be represented by
   readily measurable functional traits underlying variation in germination
   phenologies.

AB The individual and combined effect of moist-chilling and thermo-priming
   on germination parameters (capacity, speed, lag and dormancy index) were
   evaluated using seed lots representing British Columbia's five white
   spruce (Picea glauca) seed planning zones. The combined effect of
   moist-chilling followed by a 3-day priming at 15 or 20 degrees C,
   stimulated seed germination across all seed lots. These combined
   treatments resulted in substantial improvement of all germination
   parameters including reducing the dormancy index (14 vs. 25). Generally,
   three days of priming at 20 degrees C yielded a higher percent
   germination than priming for the same period at 15 degrees C,
   irrespective of whether or not seeds had received a previous
   moist-chilling treatment. Thermo-priming alone led to some improvement
   in germination characteristics such as reducing the time to germination
   onset (lag) and increasing germination speed. These results indicate
   that the combined application of moist-chilling and thermo-priming could
   improve container nursery practices for commercial seedling production
   of white spruce. The positive combined effect of moist-chilling and
   thermo-priming on seed germination offer great potential for generalised
   application to other conifers; however, species-specific treatment
   adjustment is required.

AB The dormancy breaking and storage behavior of Garcinia cowa Roxb. seeds
   were investigated. The seeds of G. cowa had 8-11 months dormancy in
   their natural habitat. Seeds were matured and dispersed at the end of
   the rainy season (mid-late August to late September) and were
   scatter-hoarded by rodents as food for winter after the seeds had fallen
   to the ground. Seedlings often emerged in the forest during the rainy
   season (May to August) the following year. Intact seeds of G. cowa
   failed to germinate after being sown at 30 degreesC for 120 d and the
   mean germination time (MGT) of seeds cultured in a shade (50% sunlight)
   nursery was 252 d. The most effective method of breaking dormancy was to
   remove the seed coat totally, which reduced the MGT to 13 d at 30
   degreesC. Germination was also promoted by partial removal of the seed
   coat (excising the hilum and exposing the radicle) and chemical
   scarification (immersion in 1% H2O2 for 1 d). Unscarified seeds take up
   water rapidly in the first 96 h, but water was absorbed by the outside
   seed coat, without penetrating through it. The moisture content (MC) of
   G. cowa seeds was high (50% in fresh weight) at shedding. The seeds
   could tolerate desiccation to some extent, until the MC reached
   approximately 40%; below that, the viability decreases rapidly and all
   seeds died at approximately 17% of MC. Seed viability decreased rapidly
   when seeds were chilled at 4 degreesC; germination was 2% after storage
   for 1 week. Even stored at 10 degreesC, seeds began to be damaged after
   4 weeks. Seed storage for 1 yr revealed that in both dry (relative
   humidity (35 +/- 5)%) and moist (wet sand) storage conditions, seed
   viability declined, but germination percentages for seeds stored under
   moist conditions are better than for seed stored under dry conditions.
   Because of their low tolerance to desiccation, marked chilling
   sensitivity and relatively short lifespan, G. cowa seeds should be
   classified into the tropical recalcitrant category. The ecological
   implications of dormant recalcitrant seeds and cues on storing
   recalcitrant seeds were discussed.

AB Ecological (climatic and geographic) variation in early life-history
   transitions is a vital determinant of the adaptive evolution of timing
   of seed germination. This study aimed to investigate the correlation
   between timing of seed germination and environmental conditions during
   seed development. We examined seed germination timing of 15 coniferous
   seed lots of lodgepole pine, 'interior' spruce and western hemlock
   collected from natural stands in British Columbia (BC), Canada, under
   manipulated [stratification, thermopriming (15 or 20 degrees C) and
   their combinations] and non-manipulated (control) conditions. Timing of
   seed germination showed strong and positive correlation with the
   temperature-based environmental condition during seed development. This
   pattern persisted across species and seed lots within species,
   substantiating the historic importance of environmental conditions
   during seed development and maturation to life-history traits. Moreover,
   the strategy of phenotypic plasticity affecting timing of seed
   germination was observed across the applied germination treatments.
   These results provide insight into the germination niche as affected by
   global warming, indicating that conifers' seed dormancy in BC (north of
   54 degrees N) tends to increase and the changes associated with early
   spring warm-up are expected to accelerate seedling emergence, as
   shortened winters would have a minimal effect on dormancy decay.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - Method for creating new self-flowering and
   fruiting germplasm for pome fruit trees by inter-genus hybridization
   involves (a) performing parental selection by selecting high-quality
   apple varieties such as 'Fuji' and 'Golden Crown' as a female parent,
   and pear varieties with a high self-flowering rate ( greater than or
   equal to 20%) as the male parent to configure a hybrid combination, (b)
   collecting pollen by in the large bud stage of pear blossoms, using
   robust trees to collect side flowers, after the anthers are collected,
   placing in a clean environment at 20-25 degrees C, drying naturally and
   collecting pollen, where the pollen germination rate is greater than or
   equal to 60%, (c) in the bud stage of apple flowers, when the flowers
   are in buds, maintaining optimum field temperature of 10-25 degrees C
   and time of 9 AM-16 PM, (d) pollinating by selecting 2 strong side
   flowers for each inflorescence, cutting off all the other flowers,
   carefully removing the apple anthers with tweezers before pollination to
   avoid damaging the stigma, then using pear pollen for pollination and
   pollinating 1 pear flower with 2 apple flowers, (e) performing
   post-pollination management by bagging immediately after pollination to
   prevent other pollen contamination and removing pollination bag after 1
   week, (f) collecting hybrid seed by harvesting the hybrid fruit from the
   tree when the fruit reaches commercial maturity, after the harvest,
   storing the fruit indoors at room temperature for 15-30 days to make the
   seeds fully mature and then carefully removing the seeds from the fruit
   to avoid injury Seed coat, (g) performing seed stratification by in the
   middle and late December, immersing the seeds in purified water at 25
   degrees C for 24 hours, then mixing with clean and sterilized fine sand,
   where the water content of the sand is 60% and the volume ratio of the
   seed to the fine sand is 1:10, then placing the sand mixture into a
   layered bag and placing into the pit that is dug outdoors beforehand,
   where the sand mixture is 20 cm away from the ground, and (h) sowing by
   in the first ten days of March, taking out the stratified seeds, placing
   indoors at 25 degrees C for 3 days, then using plugs and root pots for
   single seed sowing on the seedbed in the greenhouse, maintaining the
   water content of the substrate at 60% and after 5-6 true leaves have
   grown, moving to the field for storage.

AB The effect of prechilling on the range of possible germination
   temperatures and light sensitivity of Paulownia tomentosa was
   investigated to determine whether or not the species displays
   physiological seed dormancy. Unchilled seeds of P. tomentosa almost
   [all] germinated under continuous illumination conditions at 20 and
   25°C, while at 15 and 30°C the germination rate was about 40%. The
   germination rate of seeds treated by prechilling at 5°C almost reached
   100% under continuous light conditions at 15-30°C. This shows that a
   prechilling treatment can expand the range of possible germination
   temperatures of the species. The prechilling treatment also enhances the
   light sensitivity of P. tomentosa seeds, although prechilled seeds still
   cannot germinate without illumination. It is concluded that P. tomentosa
   seeds do display the characteristics of physiological dormancy.

   persistent low-temperature stratification was an essential treatment to
   break seed dormancy, and the optimum stratification duration time was
   105-120 d. The study also showed that the germination rate and seedling
   emergence rate was 82.43 and 60.35%, respectively, after the seeds had
   been treated with 200 mg/litre IAA for 30 h, and then stratified at low
   temperature for 120 d. The seedling emergence rate, transplanting
   survival rate of seedlings and the seedling preservation rate in the
   field were 48.08-53.62%, 91.07-98.28 and 84.26-90.20%, respectively for
   the three provenances from Shitai County (Anhui Province), Dawu County
   (Hubei Province) and Tongbai County, (Henan Province). The average

AB The cultivation of wild asparagus does not require many input because it
   adapts very easily to adverse pedoclimatic conditions. The main limit to
   its cultivation is the long time necessary for germination and the low
   germinability of seeds. In this study, the effect of cold plasma
   pretreatment on wild asparagus seed germination was evaluated. Seed
   plasma pretreatments (mixtures of O-2/N-2 applied for different times)
   were compared with conventional ones, namely: soaking (water), priming
   (polyethylene glycol), and hormonal (gibberellic acid). The effects of
   seed stratification and temperature on germination were also
   investigated. The stratification reduced the time required for
   germination of about 180 d. Plasma treatment, gas feed with 20-80%
   O-2/N-2 for 1 min, resulted more effective in increasing the germination
   percentage (by 15%) and reduced of 5 d the time to reach half of maximum
   germination percentage (T-50). This performance is related to both the
   increase in water uptake and the fungal disinfectant properties of
   plasma treatment. This study confirms that the application of cheap and
   eco-friendly cold plasma technology could provide improvements in the
   cultivation of wild asparagus.

AB Two previously described morphs of Brachypodium sylvaticum,
   distinguished by the presence or absence of macrohairs at the leaf
   margins, were studied. The distribution of the morphs was strongly
   habitat correlated; the non-hairy-edged morph (NHE) was restricted to
   shaded sites whereas the hairy-edged morph (HE) occurred in shaded and
   unshaded sites but was more frequent in the latter. Both morphs had 18
   chromosomes and similar DNA C-values (0.5 pg). There were differences
   between morphs in leaf anatomy, cuticle thickness and macrohair and
   prickle hair distribution but not in stomatal frequency and
   distribution. In laboratory germination trials, the HE morph achieved
   full germination within 5 weeks of imbibition whereas NHE seed required
   over a year to achieve max. germination and <10% germinated within 5
   weeks. Red light stimulated germination in a proportion of both morphs.
   Post imbibition chilling increased the dark germination rate of both
   morphs and also induced a degree of light sensitivity in the seeds of
   each. However, the morphs did not differ in their germination response
   in an autumn-sown field experiment; over 85% of each seed population
   remained dormant throughout winter and germinated during Mar.-Apr. There
   were large differences between the morphs in performance in a field
   transplant experiment in adjacent shaded and unshaded sites. Mortality
   of NHE plants was greater than that of HE plants in unshaded sites and
   the reverse was true in shaded sites. These differences were in accord
   with their field distribution. In laboratory experiments, the HE morph
   was much less susceptible to slug grazing than the NHE morph. This
   differential sensitivity may be a consequence of differences in leaf
   structure and anatomy, but there was some evidence that it might have a
   chemical basis.

AB Background and Aims Karrikinolide (KAR(1)) is a smoke-derived chemical
   that can trigger seeds to germinate. A potential application for KAR(1)
   is for synchronizing the germination of weed seeds, thereby enhancing
   the efficiency of weed control efforts. Yet not all species germinate
   readily with KAR(1), and it is not known whether seemingly
   non-responsive species can be induced to respond. Here a major agronomic
   weed family, the Brassicaceae, is used to test the hypothesis that a
   stimulatory response to KAR(1) may be present in physiologically dormant
   seeds but may not be expressed under all circumstances.
   Methods Seeds of eight Brassicaceae weed species (Brassica tournefortii,
   Raphanus raphanistrum, Sisymbrium orientale, S. erysimoides, Rapistrum
   rugosum, Lepidium africanum, Heliophila pusilla and Carrichtera annua)
   were tested for their response to 1 mu M KAR(1) when freshly collected
   and following simulated and natural dormancy alleviation, which included
   wet-dry cycling, dry after-ripening, cold and warm stratification and a
   2 year seed burial trial.
   Key Results Seven of the eight Brassicaceae species tested were
   stimulated to germinate with KAR(1) when the seeds were fresh, and the
   remaining species became responsive to KAR(1) following wet-dry cycling
   and dry after-ripening. Light influenced the germination response of
   seeds to KAR(1), with the majority of species germinating better in
   darkness. Germination with and without KAR(1) fluctuated seasonally
   throughout the seed burial trial.
   Conclusions KAR(1) responses are more complex than simply stating
   whether a species is responsive or non-responsive; light and temperature
   conditions, dormancy state and seed lot all influence the sensitivity of
   seeds to KAR(1), and a response to KAR(1) can be induced. Three response
   types for generalizing KAR(1) responses are proposed, namely inherent,
   inducible and undetected. Given that responses to KAR(1) were either
   inherent or inducible in all 15 seed lots included in this study, the
   Brassicaceae may be an ideal target for future application of KAR(1) in
   weed management.

AB This research was carried out to evaluate the germination and vigor of
   annatto seeds (Bixa orellana L.) during maturation, collecting samples
   70, 77, and 84 days after anthesis (DAA). The research consisted of two
   phases: first, seed samples of each harvest were submitted to different
   treatments: (i) mechanical scarification; (ii) thermotherapy (70 degrees
   C in water bath) for 1, 2, and 3 min; (iii) prechilling at 3 degrees C
   during seven days, using distilled water or KNO3 solution to moist the
   paper towel, and untreated intact seeds (control). In the second phase,
   seed samples (70, 77, and 84 DAA) were submitted to accelerated aging
   (AA) (42 degrees C, 100% relative humidity) for 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60,
   72, 84, and 96 hours. In both phases, seeds were sub sampled for
   evaluation. The germination of intact seeds collected 70, 77, and 84 DAA
   was 51, 53, and 16%, respectively, and thermotherapy was the only
   treatment that significantly altered it. Although hindering the
   germination of seeds collected 70 DAA, thermotherapy for 1 and 3 minutes
   enhanced germination in seeds collected 84 DAA (62 and 55%,
   respectively), In intact seeds, the germination rate (GR) of seeds
   collected 84 DAA (0.51) was significantly lower than in seeds collected
   70 (1.90) and 77 DAA (2.32). However, thermotherapy significantly
   increased GR for seeds collected at 84 DAA (1.65, 3.03, 1.83,
   respectively for 1, 3, and 5 minutes of immersion), which suggests the
   occurrence of dormancy after the alleged physiological maturation point
   (84 DAA). For seeds collected 70 DAA, accelerated aging (AA) up to 96
   hours did not interfered in germination. For seeds collected 77 and 84
   DAA, germination decreased as exposure time to AA increased. Seeds
   collected 70 DAA had the highest proportion of regular seedlings.

AB The breeding program carried out at Centro de Investigacion La

   adapted to soil and climatic conditions of the Jerte Valley (Spain). The
   main objectives of this research are, firstly, to improve certain
   physicochemical properties of native varieties cultivated in the valley
   and, secondly, to diversify this product with modern varieties with new
   features such as both early and late ripening, and improved organoleptic
   quality. Different varieties from the Jerte Valley germplasm bank and
   breeding programs in the USA and Canada, with interesting traits such as
   earliness, high productive potential, self-fertility, tolerance to
   rain-cracking, large size, firmness of flesh and good organoleptic
   quality, were used as parentals. In relation to fruit-set, varying
   percentages were obtained depending on year and crossing, being the
   highest value obtained using cv 'Hudson' as a female parent. The
   influence of cold storage in seed germination was also studied, showing
   that a 60 days cold storage period followed by stratification improves
   embryo viability and plant survival in greenhouse, shortening
   germination time and increasing the efficiency of field establishment.
   In some crossings the number of established seedling is over 200 and,
   currently, there are 1,828 plants (seedlings) in field. The selection
   process based on fruit quality traits will begin in 2010.

AB The populations of wild chili pepper (Capsicum annuum var.

   germinative ability, is of great importance for its management and
   conservation. The effects of the temperature on germination of wild
   chili grown in two environment of light, and the relation with the
   weight of 100 seeds of five populations of wild chili of the Northwest
   of Mexico, were recorded. The mother plants grown in greenhouse
   conditions with 50 and 100% of solar light. The treatments applied in
   the germination cameras matched: Fluctuating temperature (25-35°C) and
   constant temperature (25°C). The treatment variables were the following:
   percentage of final germination and mean germination time (T50). These
   variables performed a greatest treatment response of fluctuating
   temperature. A widely variation among 50 and 100% of light was recorded
   with natural conditions. These temperature fluctuations are determinant
   in germinative processes. The temperature performed a significantly
   response in terms of the effect in germination velocity (T50) but not in
   germination percentage. The final germination was not significantly
   correlated with the seed weight due to maternal effects. In addition,
   plants grown in greenhouse conditions, differentiate among populations
   with a genetic basis.

   has not been investigated. We assessed T-50 in paired sera collected at
   baseline and at 24 months in 188 prevalent European HD patients from the
   ISAR cohort, most of whom were Caucasians. Patients were followed for
   another 19 [interquartile range: 11-37] months. Serum T-50 exhibited a
   significant decline between baseline and 24 months (246 +/- 64 to 190
   +/- 68 minutes; p < 0.001). With serum Delta-phosphate showing the
   strongest independent association with declining T-50 (r = -0.39; p <
   0.001) in multivariable linear regression. The rate of decline of T-50
   over 24 months was a significant predictor of all-cause (HR = 1.51 per
   1SD decline, 95% CI: 1.04 to 2.2; p = 0.03) and cardiovascular mortality
   (HR = 2.15; 95% CI: 1.15 to 3.97; p = 0.02) in Kaplan Meier and
   multivariable Cox-regression analysis, while cross-sectional T-50 at
   inclusion and 24 months were not. Worsening serum calcification
   propensity was an independent predictor of mortality in this small

   needed to assess the value of calcification propensity as a longitudinal
   parameter for risk stratification and monitoring of therapeutic
   interventions.

AB The study of seed germination of endangered flora species is vital for
   conservation strategies. In this context, performed germination
   experiments were performed with a set of 37 endemic, rare or often
   endangered, taxa of the Sierra Nevada high mountain (SE Spain), an area
   that constitutes a hotspot of diversity in the Mediterranean region.
   Seed germination varied depending on the species, from 0% to ca. 95%. A
   group of 10 species belonging to 9 families showed a low or null
   germination percentage. Dormancy in these species is likely to be
   complex and to involve some kind of physiological ground. A second group
   of species showed a germination percentage between 5 and 20%, most of
   these belonging to families producing hard-coated seeds (e.g.
   Papillionaceae, Geraniaceae). Treatments to promote their germination
   were thus easy to apply. A large fraction of taxa had a germination
   percentage above 20%, often above 50%. The germination percentage did
   not correlate positively with the speed of germination (estimated as the
   T-50) or with altitude, but correlated negatively (although weakly) with
   diaspore mass. Families such as Compositae, Cruciferae, Geraniaceae,
   Labiatae and Papillionaceae are identified as families where seed
   germination may not imply major problems. Aquilegia vulgaris subsp.
   nevadensis, Arenaria nevadensis, Carex camposii, Gentiana lutea, Linaria
   glacialis, Narcissus nevadensis, Nardus stricta, Odontites granatensis,
   Papaver lapeyrousianum and Sorbus hybrida need studies of dormancy
   breakage to establish guidelines to optimize management of the scant
   seed material. As a whole, the results contrast with the generalized
   idea of a high level of dormancy in alpine species.

   granarius (L.) and Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) the main pests of the
   stored cereals, and test the effect of these natural products on the
   germination of soft wheat seeds. Before bioassays, a survey was
   conducted in three representative areas in the region of Gharb to
   advance our understanding on the type of methods commonly used by
   farmers to protect the stored cereals against different pest. During our
   investigation, we found that 91% of respondents favor the use of
   synthetic insecticides and only cereals intended for self-consumption
   are treated with natural products. The results of the insecticidal
   effect of different natural products indicated that the highest
   mortality percentage was recorded with a concentration of 5% of Mentha
   pulegium powder and Capsicum frutescens. The former product induced 69 %
   and 57 % while the latter caused 36 % and 22 % mortality on the adults
   of S. granarius and T.castaneum, respectively. The germination test
   showed that these natural products have no effect on the germination
   rate of soft wheat grains. Therefore, these products can be potential
   alternative the synthetic insecticides for the protection of stored
   against pest infestation.

   were placed in a cold (15-degrees-C day, 5-degrees-C night) or warm
   (30-degrees-C day, 20-degrees-C night) growth chamber prior to bud break
   to study the influence of long-term low temperature preconditioning on
   freezing tolerance of flower ovaries. The trees bloomed after four weeks
   in the cold chamber and two weeks in the warm chamber. Ovary freezing
   tolerances were determined by either freezing whole flowering trees or
   detached flowers. When whole trees were frozen, ovaries of cold-grown
   'Junegold' survived a freezing temperature of -4.0-degrees-C, but were
   killed at -4.5-degrees-C. Also, ovaries of cold-grown 'Junegold' were
   hardier than those of warm-grown trees, with differences in ovary
   freezing survival ranging from 13 % at -4.0-degrees-C to 35 % at
   -3.0-degrees-C. However, the difference in T50 of the ovaries between
   the warm-grown and the cold-grown flowers was only 0.38-degrees-C.
   Moreover, the cold acclimation potential for ovaries of 'Junegold' peach
   was lower than that of leaves and stems by at least 3-degrees-C. Under
   detached flower freezing, ovaries of cold-grown 'Loring' were hardier
   than those of warm-grown ones, with difference of 23.3 % at
   -2.5-degrees-C. However, no differences between the cold- and warm-grown

   theoretical basis for further research on seed dormancy mechanism, we
   came to certain conclusions as below: (1)Embryo of mature seeds of M.
   sieboldii developed incompletely and seed dormancy was mainly due to
   high concentration of ABA and low concentrations of GA,;
   (2)GA(3),treatments could stimulate the morphological maturation of
   seeds by 30 days, and treatment with GA(3) of 1 500 mg . L-1 saw the
   best effect; (3)The whole temperature stratification process could be
   divided into three stages:Stage I (0-70 d), this stage was to complete
   the further differentiate of the seed embryo;Stage II(70-120 d) was the
   fast grow period of embryo; Stage III (120-150 d),seed dormancy was
   broken absolutely and seeds had the ability to sprout. Whether seeds can
   break dormancy depends on stage I. and stage II ;(4)The changes of
   GA(3)/ABA,IAA/ABA and ZR/ABA consist of embryo growth and development
   during the ripening of the seeds. The relative level of hormones played
   an important role in seed dormancy regulation.

AB Seed priming is a widely used technique in crops to obtain uniform
   germination and high-quality seedlings. In this study, we found a
   long-term effect of seed priming with gibberellic acid-3 (GA(3)) on
   plant growth and production in Leymus chinensis. Seeds were germinated
   on agar plates containing 0-200 mu M GA(3), and the germinated seedlings
   were transplanted to clay planting pots and grown for about one year.
   The clonal tillers grown from the mother plants were transplanted to
   field conditions in the second year. Results showed that GA(3) treatment
   significantly increased seed germination rate by 14-27%. GA(3) treatment
   also promoted subsequent plant growth and biomass production, as shown
   by a significant increase in plant height, tiller number, and fresh and
   dry weight in both pot (2016) and field (2017) conditions. It is
   particularly noteworthy that the growth-promoting effect of a single
   seed treatment with GA(3) lasted for at least two years. In particular,
   GA(3) treatment at 50 mu M increased aboveground fresh and dry weight by
   168.2% and 108.9% in pot-grown conditions, and 64.5% and 126.2% in
   field-grown conditions, respectively. These results imply a
   transgenerational transmission mechanism for the GA-priming effect on
   clonal offspring growth and biomass production in L. chinensis.

AB Seed dormancy status regulates the response of seeds to environmental
   cues that can trigger germination. Anigozanthos flavidus (Haemodoraceae)
   produces seeds with morphophysiological dormancy (MPD) that are known to
   germinate in response to smoke, but embryo growth dynamics and
   germination traits in response to temperatures and after-ripening have
   not been well characterized. Seeds of A. flavidus, after-ripened for 28
   months at 15 degrees C/15 % relative humidity, were incubated on water
   agar, water agar containing 1 mu M karrikinolide (KAR(1)) or 50 mu M
   glyceronitrile at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 20/10 and 25/15 degrees C for 28
   days. After incubation at 5, 10 and 25 degrees C for 28 days, seeds were
   transferred to 15 degrees C for another 28 days. Embryo growth dynamics
   were tested at 5, 10, 15 and 25 degrees C. Results demonstrated that
   fresh seeds of A. flavidus had MPD and the physiological dormancy (PD)
   component could be broken by either glyceronitrile or dry
   after-ripening. After-ripened seeds germinated to >= 80 % at 15-20
   degrees C while no additional benefit of germination was observed in the
   presence of the KAR(1) or glyceronitrile. Embryo length significantly
   increased at 10 degrees C, and only slightly increased at 5 degrees C,
   while growth did not occur at 25 degrees C. When un-germinated seeds
   were moved from 5-10 degrees C to 15 degrees C for a further 28 days,
   germination increased from 0 to >80 % in significantly less time
   indicating that cold stratification may play a key role in the
   germination process during winter and early spring in A. flavidus. The
   lower germination (<50 %) of seeds moved from 25 to 15 degrees C was
   produced by the induction of secondary dormancy. Induction of secondary
   dormancy in seeds exposed to warm stratification, a first report for
   Anigozanthos species, suggests that cycling of PD may be an important
   mechanism of controlling germination timing in the field.

   by 0.69 d and 0.85 d, respectively. The seedling length of MS Yunyan 87
   was increased by 0.23 cm, seedling dry weight of MSK326 was increased by
   0.29 g as compared to the control. When pelleted seeds were germinated
   under 10°C, the treatment with 100 mg/L GA3 under 25°C for 24 hours was
   better for MS Yunyan 87 than others, whose germination index was
   increased by 18.05% and germination time was shorten by 1.84 d.
   Meanwhile, the treatment with 50 mg/L GA3 under 20°C for 24 hours was
   better for MSK326, whose germination index was increased by 14.58%,
   germination time was shorten by 1.55 d. The results indicated that
   suitable GA3 priming treatment could enhance the pelleted seed vigor and
   seedling quality of tobacco, and enhance the chilling resistance of
   pelleted seeds.

AB The ability of solid matrix priming (SMP) to overcome seed dormancy of
   seeds of four fir species (Pacific silver fir, subalpine fir, grand fir
   and noble fir), was examined. Seeds were subjected to treatments that
   combined moist chilling and SMP (SMP-chilling) and their germination
   compared to that elicited by traditional moist chilling. For the
   SMP-chilling, six solid matrices with different water holding capacities
   were tested (sphagnum, cat litter, peat moss, Agro-Lig Greens Grade,
   Agro-Lig Micro Fine and sand). For each of the species tested,
   germination performance was significantly improved by SMP-chilling; the
   results were dependent on the type of solid matrix, the matrix water
   content and the treatment duration. SMP-chilling, using the best solid
   matrices for each of the species tested, resulted in germination
   percentages and rates that were 24-35% and 8-21% higher, respectively,
   as compared with that yielded from control moist-chilling. High
   germination percentages (79% or greater) of three of the four species
   (Pacific silver fir, subalpine fir, and grand fir) were promoted after
   just four weeks (grand fir in sand) or eight weeks of treatment (Pacific
   silver fir in peat moss and subalpine fir in Agro-Lig Greens Grade). The
   germination rate of grand fir seeds benefited from SMP-chilling periods
   longer than four weeks, but this resulted in germination during the
   dormancy-breaking treatment. The water contents of the solid matrices
   that were optimal in terms of eliciting the best germination performance
   were 320% (w/w) for peat moss, 40% for Agro-Lig Greens Grade and 5-15%
   for sand. Conducting SMP at chilling temperatures (4 degreesC) is a
   practical approach to shorten the time required for effective dormancy
   termination of Abies seeds; treatment times were shortened by 27 days
   for Pacific silver fir and subalpine fir and more vigorous seedling
   growth was exhibited by grand fir and noble fir.

PY 2007
AB Stevia rebaudiana (Bertoni) Bertoni is a perennial shrub of the
   Asteraceae family native to Paraguay and Brazil where it has been used
   for several years as a sweetener. It is a short-day species, with a
   critical light requirement for flowering of roughly 13 hours. In plants
   whose biological cycle is strongly photoperiod-dependent, latitude is
   one of the major factors influencing reproduction. Late flowering may
   adversely affect seed production if this occurs during a season that is
   unfavorable to pollination. At Italian latitudes, this species often
   gives scanty seed production, with low germination rate and poor
   germination energy of seeds produced. In 2001 four accessions have been
   grown for seed production in a field plot experiment in Central Italy.
   The various accessions were found to exhibit noticeably different
   photoperiod requirements, which affected flowering time (from late
   August to the end of September) and consequently also the conditions of
   achene filling and ripening. Late flowering and seed ripening occurred
   during autumn season, unfavourable to complete seed formation, leading
   to an increase in the empty seed percentage recorded for each accession.
   Detailed germination trials were therefore undertaken using seeds
   collected from plants of the different accessions in order to assess the
   quality of the seeds produced. Various germination methods have been
   tested in a controlled environment adopting four different temperatures
   (20°C, 25°C constant temperature and 15/25°C, 20/30°C (16/8 h)
   alternating temperature) in light or darkness with or without
   pre-chilling. Germination rates varied over an extensive range
   (germination percentage from 9 to 83%), mainly due to the divergent
   specific characteristics of the material examined and the different
   treatments studied. At all temperatures tested, the most earlier
   accession, showed the higher germination percentages (54-83%) while the
   latest accession was among those with the lowest germination values
   (9-44%). Overall, at the constant temperatures assayed, pre-chilling
   gave a higher germination percentage as compared to no pre-chilling,
   while at alternating temperatures higher germination rates were obtained
   in the absence of pre-chilling. The great variability observed between
   accessions for photoperiodic requirement as well as in seed germinative
   characteristics was probably due to the fact that this species was not
   subjected to any genetic improvement program.

   water; these responses were dependent on the type of stratification, and
   three of these species only had a positive response to smoke water +
   KNO3 solution. Five species responded positively to KNO3 and four of
   those were associated with smoke water + KNO3 solution. Smoke water
   induced germination of several species, but only for seeds that had been
   previously cold-stratified. Vaccinium myrtilloides Michx. had the
   largest increase in germination using smoke water and the most reduced
   germination using KNO3. The interactions between smoke water, KNO3, and

   of smoke water and KNO3 (or other nitrogen sources) should be further
   researched to determine alternative approaches to restoration of

AB Seeds of Rosmarinus officinalis L. (rosemary) exhibit slow and irregular

   effects of constant and alternating temperatures following cold
   stratification, incubation with GA3 under different temperature regimes,
   chemical scarification with sulfuric acid, and seed lot on the
   germination of rosemary seeds were studied. Prolonging the cold
   stratification period increased germination after 28 d (G28), and
   decreased days to 50% germination (T50). Temperature following cold
   stratification interacted with stratification period to increase
   germination rate. GA3 increased G28, and reduced T50, and the number of
   days between 10% and 90% germination (T90  T10). Temperature regime
   influenced all three parameters, but did not interact with GA3.
   Germination was greatest after 15 min exposure to H2SO4, while T50
   decreased from 17.8 d in the untreated control to 11.5 d after 120 min
   exposure to H2SO4. Extract of rosemary seeds did not inhibit germination
   and growth of Lepidium sativum L. (garden cress) seedlings, indicating
   inhibitory chemicals in the rosemary seed coat are not likely to be
   responsible for germination irregularities in rosemary. Differences in
   percentage of filled seeds and embryo length may account for differences
   in germination among seed lots. Our study demonstrates multiple
   mechanisms are likely responsible for release from physiological
   dormancy and irregular germination in rosemary seeds.

   treatment. Total germination percentage was most significantly improved
   by cold stratification at 5 2 degrees C for 10 weeks after warm
   stratification at 20 degrees C for 2 weeks; however, a substantial
   amount of germination occurred during the prestratification period, thus
   resulting in a crop with poor uniformity. A total of 10 mg center dot
   L-1 GA(3) significantly improved the G21, T-50, and T-90-T-10 values.
   Although GA(3) concentration and duration of cold stratification period
   interacted significantly when the two were combined, the additive
   effects of GA(3) and cold stratification did not significantly improve
   G21 values over those obtained with GA(3) alone nor were T-50 values
   improved over those obtained with cold stratification alone. Potassium
   nitrate did not influence the T-50 and T-90-T-10 values and improved G21
   only, slightly. Light was found to be necessary for germination. Surface
   sterilization with 10% bleach decreased the growth of fungi on seeds but
   had no significant effect on the germination responses of P. pilosa
   seeds. Application of GA(3) at 10 mg center dot L-1 is a promising
   method for improving seed germination in perennial Phlox species.

AB Lolium rigidum Gaudin. and L. prenne L. species, which are from poaceae
   category are two forage species of high importance in terms of
   palatability and production. In this investigation, a factorial
   experiment based on a completely randomized design with three
   replications was performed, 4, 6, 8 weeks and seeds at 22° C was used as
   control. Subsequently, parameters such as germination percentage (GP),
   germination rate (GR), germination value (GV) and germination index (GI)
   of Lolium rigidum Gaudin. and L. prenne L. were evaluated. The results
   showed that the effect of cold treatment was significant (p≤0.01) on GP,
   GV, GI and GR of two species. In general, it can be concluded that cold
   treatment in the positive way to improve the performance and to increase
   the seed germination of Lolium rigidum Gaudin. and L. prenne L.

AB Seeds of Aesculus indica shown immediately after collection in the month
   of October-November resulted in poor germination. In natural conditions,
   seeds took about 4-5 months to germinate. Stratification of seeds for 15
   or 30 days resulted in enhanced germination percentage as well as
   shorter mean time to germination (M.T.G). In the laboratory, the
   seedlings grown in pure sand medium showed hyper-elongation due to
   etiolation but survived transplanting in polypots, following hardening
   in a  shaded place for a couple of days. There was no significant effect
   of stratification on seedlings growth. A. indica seeds required a brief
   period of chilling and subsequent higher temperature during incubation
   for accelerating the germination and seedling growth.

AB In seeds of many summer annuals low temperatures under moist conditions
   provoke dormancy release while high temperatures induce secondary
   dormancy. Seed dormancy level establishes the range of temperatures
   under which germination is possible. The range of temperatures
   permissive for seed germination is determined by two threshold limit
   temperatures: Lower limit temperature (T-l) and High limit temperature
   (T-h). Numerous studies have been conducted to characterize the effect
   of temperature on dormancy release, but there is very few information on
   how temperature regulates secondary dormancy induction. Seeds of
   Polygonum aviculare were stratified at 1.6, 5 and 10 degrees C until
   achieving a minimum dormancy, and then were induced into secondary
   dormancy by further storage at 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C. Based on
   obtained germination time course-curves we quantified changes in the
   thermal range permissive for seed germination through variations in the
   mean lower limit temperature for seed germination (Too)) using a
   mathematical simulation germination model. Our data suggest that
   induction into secondary dormancy in P. aviculare seeds can be assessed
   quantitatively through changes in T-l(50). This changes could be
   described through a Dormancy Induction Thermal-Time Index (DItt), in
   which thermal time units are accumulated above a threshold temperature
   from which secondary dormancy is induced (7.9 degrees C). Additionally,
   the induction-rate into secondary dormancy was affected by the
   stratification temperature during dormancy release. We conclude that the
   effect of temperature on the rate of dormancy induction is not only
   dependent on prevailing temperature, but also on temperature experienced
   by seeds during previous dormancy release and the resulting dormancy
   status of the seed population. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

AB Only a few studies have been performed on seed germination of perennial
   ephemeral species native to the cold deserts of central Asia. We
   hypothesized that seeds of the cold desert perennial ephemeralLeontice
   incertaexhibit versatility in the timing of germination, that is, having
   the capacity to germinate at any time in summer, autumn and next spring.
   At dispersal in late May, only about 30% of the seeds could germinate;
   thus, a high percentage of the seeds was dormant. Seeds had a fully
   developed embryo, and dry storage, cold stratification, warm
   stratification and gibberellin promoted germination; we concluded that
   they have non-deep physiological dormancy. Seeds buried under natural
   conditions during summer germinated to 57-86% in autumn (late October)
   when exhumed and incubated at 5/2-25/15 degrees C. However, seeds were
   sown in soil exposed to natural temperature and (low) precipitation did
   not germinate until next spring when the soil was moist. Thus, like
   various cold desert annuals, seeds of the perennialL. incertacan
   germinate in summer, autumn and next spring, depending on the
   availability of soil moisture (rainfall). Rainfall in cold deserts can
   play an important role in shaping seed germination traits of desert
   plants.

AB Starry rosinweed (Silphium asteriscus) is a native wildflower of
   Florida's pine flatwoods. This herbaceous perennial reaches 3 to 5 ft
   and bears yellow ray florets from May through September. Starry
   rosinweed is gaining popularity as a landscape plant, but there is
   little information available that describes methods for propagating this
   species by either sexual or asexual means. The objective of this study
   was to determine the effect of pretreatments on germination of S.
   asteriscus seeds. Seeds were collected in Sept. and Oct. 2008 and stored
   in polyethylene bags or moist stratified in potting media for 30 days at
   39 degrees F. Subsequently, seeds that were stored in polyethylene bags
   at 39 degrees F were either water-soaked for 24 hours before planting or
   left dry. Before sowing, half of the seeds from each of the three
   previously described treatment combinations were cleaned by removing the
   pericarp to produce a total of six different treatment combinations that
   could affect seed germination. A second set of seeds was collected that
   were described as the fresh (not stored) sample. These seeds were either
   water-soaked or left dry. At planting time, half the seeds from each of
   these two treatments were cleaned by removing the pericarp. This
   resulted in four additional treatment combinations using fresh seed. All
   10 treatment combinations were sown under greenhouse conditions (average
   temperature 73 degrees F). Separate and combined effects of storage,
   cleaning, and soaking were examined in an analysis that excluded seeds
   that were stratified. A second analysis looked at the combined effects
   of stratification and cleaning and excluded fresh seeds. The treatment
   that had the largest effect on percent germination and time to germinate
   was stratification. Mean time to germinate was 4.3 days for seed that
   received the moist-stratification treatment and a germination percentage
   of 93% was observed at 2 weeks. The time for seed to germinate was
   substantially slower and germination percentages were lower for all
   other treatment combinations that did not include stratification.
   Soaking and cleaning had some effect on germination rate. Storage and
   soaking affected the time for seeds to germinate when effects of
   stratification were excluded.

AB Knowledge of seed germination behaviour of different seed sources of
   tree species is useful in selecting the most responsive and adaptive
   ones for propagation and germplasm conservation. The wild Himalayan pear
   (Pyrus pashia Buch-Ham ex D. Don) produces highly nutritious edible
   fruits that are consumed by local communities. The populations of the
   species are threatened due to exploitation and lack of adequate
   conservation programmes. The study was conducted to examine the
   germination response of P. pashia seeds from two sources (S1-Champawat
   and S2-Pithoragarh) in Uttarakhand state of India, to different GA3
   treatment and also to assess the viability and longevity of the seeds in
   cold storage (5°C) for three years. In both sources germination percent
   (GP) increased significantly under GA3 treatment and speed of
   germination was also enhanced (reduction in mean germination time). In
   Source, 1 GP increased under all GA3 application, highest being 94%
   under GA3 500 ppm treatment. In Source 2, GP of seeds doubled under 100
   ppm GA3 treatment while its higher concentrations did not improve the
   germination. However, the differences observed in germination between
   the seed sources could be due to differences in the dormancy levels
   and/or sensitivity to dormancy breaking elements across their
   geographical range. Thus, exogenous application of GA3is suggested for
   enhancing the germination in seeds of P. pashia. Seeds responded to cold
   storage by increased germination with duration, i.e. highest after three
   years in storage, indicating that the seeds got the required chilling
   treatment for overcoming dormancy.

AB Capsicum peppers are one of the most important vegetables in the world
   and continuous breeding efforts are required to improve yield,
   resistances, or fruit traits. In this sense, breeding programs usually
   last many years because many generations each with several months are
   needed. Therefore, the isolation and in vitro germination of immature
   embryos might be helpful to shorten breeding cycles and accelerate
   breeding programs. Here, we evaluated the efficiency of this strategy in
   Capsicum annuum under both Autumn-Winter (AW) and Spring-Summer (SS)
   growing conditions. Five accessions, representing different varietal
   types, were included in this experiment and immature advanced embryos
   (torpedoearly cotyledonary) were used because of their high in vitro
   germination aptitude. Conventional breeding cycles (control) ranged
   between 148 and 184 days in AW and between 117 and 154 days in SS,
   indicating that no more than two generations per year are possible in
   peppers. By contrast, the in vitro strategy reduced the cycle length by
   33-70 days in the AW season and by 13-56 days in the SS season, with
   California accessions showing the highest shortenings. These findings
   show that this strategy will allow Capsicum breeders to obtain three
   generations per year in California peppers, and up to four generations
   in cayenne peppers. Furthermore, compared to controls, in
   vitro-germinated plantlets showed the same high pollen fertility, and no
   deleterious effects were observed in their subsequent development (plant
   height and biomass). Therefore, these plants can be integrated safely in
   breeding programs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB A new reliable in vitro technique for immature embryos of Capsicum spp.
   was developed. A collection of 10 accessions, encompassing the five
   cultivated species of Capsicum, and four media formulations, combining
   different levels of sucrose (40 g/L vs. 80 g/L) and MS salts (1/2 x MS
   vs. 1 x MS), were evaluated. In addition, the four main embryo stages
   (i.e. globular, heart, torpedo, early cotyledonary) were also
   considered. Thus, almost 2000 embryos were excised, cultured, and
   evaluated for germination in the present experiment. Genotype (G), media
   composition (M), and developmental stage (S) contributed significantly
   to culture efficiency. G x S and S x M interactions were also
   significant, although their contribution was lower than individual main
   factors. C annuum accession Piquillo, C frutescens B-144 and,
   particularly, C pubescens B-61 showed the highest in vitro germination
   rates, while C chinense and C baccatum accessions showed, in general,
   the lowest responses. In most cases, the more advanced the embryo stage
   the higher the culture efficiency. However, for the first time in
   Capsicum globular embryos from most genotypes were germinated in vitro
   and also relatively high rates. were achieved for heart embryos.
   Finally, the medium with the lowest levels of both sucrose (40 g/L) and
   MS eh x MS) enabled, in most genotypes and stages of development, the
   highest in vitro germination rates. In fact, this medium allowed rates
   of up to 25% in globular embryos. These results provide useful
   information to those breeders interested on the applications of embryo
   culture in Capsicum peppers (e.g. shortening breeding cycles, perhaps
   rescue of interspecific embryos). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   morphology, water absorption, and the effects of seed coat, low

   dormancy and germination specificity. The results showed that, at 60 d
   of low temperature stratification treatment, the dormancy of Lonicera

   Two kinds of rose seeds were further treated with grinded seed coat and
   combined with low temperature stratification. The seed germination rates

   stratification. The dormancy was basically relieved. The germination
   rate of Lonicera tatarica L. seed was highest in GA3 300 mg/L treatment,
   and the germination rate was 91.1% (low temperature stratification 60
   d). The seed germination rate of the three GA3 concentrations was higher

   growth. Growth and vigour of the seedlings was assessed through the
   measurements of growth parameters, in order to identify the best
   pre-sowing treatment, which guarantees both the highest seed germination
   rate and the best development and growth of the seedlings. J. curcas
   seeds of the 'Indian' cultivar were collected in Tamale region (Ghana)
   and subjected to five different pre-sowing treatments: (i) control; (ii)
   soaking in 30°C water for 24 h; (iii) hammer shell cracking; (iv) warm
   stratification at 37°C for 24 h; (v) hammer shell cracking plus warm
   stratification at 37°C for 24 h. Amongst the sixteen indices considered
   in the experiment (six germination indices and ten growth rate indices),
   results revealed that the tested pre-sowing treatments influenced much
   more seed germination than seedling growth. Shell cracking treatment
   enhanced seed germination and warm stratification promoted emergence
   rate and seedling growth as compared to the other tested treatments.

AB Liriodendron tulipifera is a large, deciduous tree up to 50 m tall. It
   is admired for its tulip-like, melliferous flowers that bloom in spring.
   Tulip tree is also a good shade tree and its wood is used for furniture
   and general lumber. Recently, it became very popular as an ornamental
   tree in Serbia and we decided to research a possibility of generative
   propagation of selected two elite trees growing in the Belgrade area.
   During the experiment, the seeds collected in October were cold
   stratified in sand or in bags without a substrate, for 2, 3 or 4 months.
   Obtained results showed that quality of seeds was low with a small
   number of viable seeds. Germination rate did not exceed 16%, but the
   real germination rate (calculated as a percentage of sound seeds that
   germinate) was considerably higher, reaching 82.5%. Besides,
   considerable difference in a response to stratification method between
   seeds collected from different trees was recorded. Seeds collected from
   one of the mother trees did not show significant difference in real
   germination rate after 2 or 3 months stratification in sand (66.5% and
   64.6%, respectively), but seeds collected from the other tree had higher
   real germination rate after being stratified for 3 months in sand
   (82.5%) than after 2 months of stratification in sand (only 18.8%).
   Although genotype strongly influenced obtained results, we can conclude
   that 3 months stratification in sand showed overall the best results,
   but seed viability should be tested before its use for propagation.

AB Snake-bark maple is a small, deciduous tree that grows up to 10-15 m
   tall, with arching branching and a decorative bark and leaves. It is
   native in the mountain forests of Japan. Kyushu Maple is tolerant of
   frosts, smoke and urban sites. It is not an invasive species and it
   should be planted in green spaces in Serbia, especially as an
   alternative to invasive plant species. For this reason, we decided to
   investigate possibility of rapid and easy generative propagation of this
   species which has endogenous seed dormancy. Seeds were collected in the
   Arboretum of Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Alnarp.
   During the experiment, the seeds were cold stratified in a perlite or in
   bags without a substrate for 15 and 30 days. Parameters of seed
   germination were determined according to ISTA rules. The best results
   were achieved with seeds cold stratified in a perlite, for both
   treatments (15 or 30 days stratification). The highest germination rate
   and germination energy both 94%, were achieved after the 30 days
   treatment.

AB Capparis spinosa is a spiny, evergreen shrub, that grows to 1 m tall,
   spreading by semi-prostrate branching to 2 - 3 m wide. It is native
   mostly to Mediterranean coastal regions, growing on sandy or rocky
   soils, stone walls and rock crevices. Its unopened flower buds are
   edible and used as a flavouring in sauces or salads. Also, caper bush is
   an ornamental and drough tolerant species that is suitable for landscape
   use. Generative propagation of this species is difficult due to its seed
   coat dormancy, followed by embryo dormancy that develops after drying.
   The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different seed
   treatments on dormancy breaking. The seeds collected in Perast,
   Montenegro at the end of summer, were stored for six months before
   setting the experiment. The treatments included: soaking seeds in
   sulfuric acid at 96% for 15 or 30 minutes, mechanical scarification, hot
   water (40°C) treatment, 3 months of cold stratification at 3-5°C in
   perlite, treatment with 0.2% KNO3. The obtained results showed that KNO3
   has negative impact on caper bush germination, and in all combined
   treatments, the germination rate was lower with the addition of KNO3.
   The mechanical scarification showed the best germination rate (36%), but
   it is necessary to conduct the additional research in order to improve
   germination of dried caper bush seeds.

AB Darwin's barberry is a decorative, medicinal, edible and low demanding
   evergreen shrub, grown as an ornamental plant in Western Europe. This
   species should be used in green spaces in Serbia more often. B. darwinii
   can be propagated by seed, but it has endogenous seed dormancy. For this
   reason, we decided to investigate which chilling treatment will be
   effective in breaking its dormancy. The seeds used in our experiments
   were collected in Hyde Park in London, and after maceration they were
   cold stratified in perlite or in bags without a substrate for 3, 4 and 5
   months. The parameters of seed germination were determined according to
   the ISTA rules. The best results were achieved with the seeds cold
   stratified in perlite for 4 and 5 months, whose germination rate was
   73.5% and 73.0% respectively. However, seeds stratified for 5 months in
   perlite had a higher germination energy (69.0%) compared with seeds
   stratified for 4 months (37.0%). There are indications that germination
   rate can be improved with combination of warm and cold stratification,
   so additional research should be conducted.

AB Propagation of blue-eyed grass (Sisyrinchium angustifolium Mill.) is
   difficult due to its embryo dormancy. The aim of this research is to
   establish a suitable method of breaking seed dormancy of this species.
   The seeds used in this experiment were collected in a private garden in
   Belgrade, and the effect of different treatments on seed germination was
   evaluated. These treatments included the application of different
   concentrations (10-3 M, 10-4 M, 10-5 M) of GA3 (gibberellic acid),
   application of 0.2% KNO3 (potassium nitrate), cold stratification (1 or
   2 months at 3-5°C) and combinations of these treatments. The obtained
   results showed that S. angustifolium requires cold pretreatment for
   germination, but germination percentage can be considerably improved by
   treating the seeds with KNO3 or GA3. Data were statistically analysed
   and the best results were achieved with the seeds treated with 10-3 M or
   10-4 M GA3 and cold stratified for 2 months (79% and 70% germination
   rate, respectively).

AB The germination and life cycle of the rare species Allium melananthum,
   endemic to southeast Spain, were investigated. One alternating and four
   constant temperature regimes and two light conditions were tested.
   Gibberellic acid and cold or warm stratification were used as dormancy
   breaking treatments. The results showed that light can inhibit seed
   germination, although the light inhibitory effects varied with
   temperature. In continuous darkness, seed germination was hardly
   affected by temperature, but in alternating light/darkness it was
   sensitive to extreme temperatures of 25 and 10 degrees C, while mild
   temperatures of 15-20 degrees C permitted successful germination.
   However, a dormant stage was observed in a small fraction of seeds,
   which was only overcome by warm stratification. By contrast, cold
   stratification induced strong secondary dormancy. This germination
   pattern shows that primary and secondary dormancy, temperature and light
   play pivotal roles as components of the germination-timing strategies of
   A. melananthum. As regards its life cycle, the juvenile phase in a low
   proportion of individuals (0.93%) lasted 2 years from seeding, while
   56.7% of individuals were capable of producing bulblets in the third
   year. We suggest that at least two growing seasons post seeding are
   necessary in the nursery to obtain suitable material for the
   introduction or reinforcement of A. melananthum populations in their
   natural habitat.

AB One of the critical points of Douglas fir seedling production is to
   optimize the time of sowing and length of pre-sowing treatment.
   Germination and emergence of Douglas fir seed lot of the Czech origin
   (CZ-2-2A-DG-1740-6-3-P) were observed in simulated warm and cold
   conditions in two phytotrons for 3 months. Before this procedure the
   seeds were exposed to different prechilling duration. The temperature in
   control conditions of phytotrons was stable for 28 days and then it was
   increased: 11, 13, 17 degrees C in cold phytotron and 13, 17, 20 degrees
   C in the warm phytotron. Seeds without stratification and stratified for
   3, 5, 7, 9 and 16 weeks were tested. The laboratory germination capacity
   of non-stratified seeds was only 58% and it was significantly (P < 0.05,
   Tukey's test) lower than in stratification treatments when it varied
   from 92% to 96%. Non-stratified seeds did not germinate in cold
   phytotron and they germinated very slowly (germination rate at the end
   of experiment was 7%) in warm phytotron. The germination capacity of
   seeds both in the phytotron and in the laboratory was observed in
   treatments with prechilling of seeds longer than 7 weeks in warm
   conditions and only for seeds after 16 weeks of prechilling in cold
   conditions. The highest emergence rate of seeds (84%) was found in the
   warm phytotron after 16 weeks of stratification. Comparable results were
   reached only for 9 weeks of stratification in the same phytotron. The
   results suggest that the prolongation of the standard 3-week prechilling
   period helps to increase germination capacity and emergence rate of
   seeds. Future research should focus on optimal length with regard to
   more seed lots and also on seedling quality parameters.

AB Germination was investigated in 1-yr and 8-yr-old seed lots of
   barnyardgrass. Each seed lot was divided into a portion stored dry at 25
   C (afterripening) and a portion buried in the field (stratification) in
   central Europe (latitude 50 degrees N, longitude 14 degrees E). The
   afterripened seed lost dormancy within 2 yr after dispersal, whereas
   buried seed passed through annual dormancy/nondormancy cycles. The seed
   was germinated at five constant temperatures between 17 and 35 C with an
   18/6-h light/dark photoperiod. Germination was affected by both seed age
   and storage conditions. Germination percentage and rate in 8-yr-old
   afterripened and each of the stratified seed lots varied with
   temperature. Optimum temperatures for germination were between 27 and 31
   C, and the range of adequate temperatures increased with seed age. A
   common base temperature for germination was 11.7 C. In 1-yr-old
   afterripened material, the proportion of germinating seed (< 5%) and
   germination rate were similar at all temperatures. Barnyardgrass thus
   revealed a plastic strategy of germination. Stratification during the
   first winter removed dormancy and allowed germination at a narrow range
   of temperatures. This constraint on optimum germination temperature
   decreased with increased seed age. Seedling emergence, thus, may vary
   according to whether seed population originates from the previous year
   or from old soil seed banks.

AB Bush okra (Corchorus olitorius L.) has a potential for production as a
   major traditional leafy vegetable crop consumed in many parts of Africa.
   It is generally propagated by seeds. However, the low germination rate
   of seeds harvested from the previous season is a big challenge. Wild
   okra seeds were thus treated with different pre-germination treatments.
   Seeds with a seed viability of 88.9% (determined using the Tetrazolium
   technique), were exposed to seven pre-treatments; water at room
   temperature (control), hot water at 100 degrees C, sulphuric acid (98%),
   dry heat at 80 degrees C, physical scarification, chilling at 6 degrees
   C and freezing for 15 min. Soaking seeds in boiling water at 100 degrees
   C for 10 s was effective in enhancing a maximum germination of 84.7% on
   Swaziland okra. The Nigerian okra seeds had 79.1% germination after
   being subjected to dry heat at 80 degrees C for 15 min. The seeds soaked
   in sulphuric acid (98%) for 15 min, resulted in 21.1% germination for
   Swaziland okra while the Nigerian okra achieved 20.8% germination.
   Scarification by rubbing the seeds with sand paper was found to be less
   effective, achieving 2.8% germination for Swaziland okra and 5.3%
   germination for Nigerian okra, while chilling and freezing gave varying
   less effective results between 1.6 and 16.9%, respectively. Soaking of
   okra seeds in boiling water for 10 s can thus be recommended as the most
   effective treatment for enhancing germination of okra seeds. This is
   also a relatively simple and cheap method.

AB Asteraceae is the most diverse family of vascular plants in the world
   and the most numerous in Argentina, with 26% of endemic species. Many
   Asteraceae are pioneer species facilitating the establishment of other
   species, and several have been employed in restoration. Knowing the
   characteristics of seeds and their germination is crucial to employ them
   in restoration projects; hence this study explored basic physiological
   aspects of the germination of Gutierrezia solbrigii Cabrera and Senecio
   subulatus D. Don ex Hook. & Arn. var. erectus Hook. & Arn., two endemic
   shrubs of Argentina, distributed in arid Patagonia. Seeds came from the
   Reserva Provincial Auca Mahuida (NE of NeuquEn Province), in the
   Phytogeografical District of Payunia (ecotone between Monte and Steppe).
   Hydrocarbon extraction activities in the reserve have originated
   degraded areas where these species could be employed with revegetation
   purposes. We evaluated germination percentage (G), time until
   germination (IG) and mean germination time (TMG) of control seeds and
   seeds subjected to pre-germinative treatments: cold moist stratification
   for 15 days (EHF15), mechanical scarification with sand and sandpaper
   (EML) for both species, and cold moist stratification for 30 days
   (EHF30) and mechanical scarification with a scalpel (EMB) for S.
   subulatus. In all treatments, germination percentage was high (G.
   solbrigii: 77% EHF15; 81% EML; S. subulatus: 88% EHF15, 89% EHF30, 84%
   EML, 94% EMB) and similar to controls (G. solbrigii: 82%, S. subulatus:
   88%). Differences were detected only between EMB and EML for S.
   subulatus: G and IG were higher in EMB and lower in TGM, probably
   because seeds were not homogenously scarified with EML. In conclusion,
   the studied species lack dormancy mechanisms under the experimental
   conditions, and since they are also endemic and grow in disturbed
   environments, they are excellent candidates to be used in restoration
   projects.

AB Ferula assa-foetida, classified in Apiaceae, natively grows in Iran.
   This species has a considerable position in traditional medicine in
   Iran. Seeds of this plant have a dormancy stage and not germinate easily
   in non-native environments. The present study accomplished to find out a
   suitable method to break seed dormancy of Ferula assa-foetida. There are
   some chemical and physical treatments to remove seed dormancy and
   consequently promoting seed germination in plants. To break seed
   dormancy, previous research suggested various techniques for different
   species in Apiaceae. Accordingly, in the current study, to find the most
   effective way, different treatments were applied to induce seed
   germination in Ferula assa-foetida including: stratification (pre-moist
   chilling) at 2°C in three duration of 5, 10, and 15 days, a combined
   treatment of gibberellic acid (500 ppm) and chilling (at 2°C for 5, 10
   and 15 days), 24-epibrassinolid (0.5 and 1 ppm, for 24 and 48 hours),
   washing (water), KNO3 (0.2%), hot water (70 and 90°C, 15 min), Sulfuric
   acid 75% (for 5 and 15 minutes). The highest percentage (33.3%) and rate
   (1.8 numbers of germinated seeds per day) of germination were obtained
   at pre-moist chilling (2°C) for 15 days. The effects of gibberellic
   acid+chilling and 24-epibrassinolid on seed germination were evaluated
   positively (in turn-20 and 15%). The results showed gibberellic acid
   (alone), wash, KNO3, sulfuric acid and hot water had no effects on
   enhancing seed germination. The results suggest seed dormancy in Ferula
   assa-foetida would not be due to a physical dormancy or remaining of
   chemical inhibitors in the peripheral layers of seeds, but might be a
   type of deep physiological dormancy and in this case chilling can even
   be more effective than hormonal treatments to induce seed germination.
   In addition, the germination rate showed positive correlation to the
   percentage of germination. Regarding to the obtained results, using a
   prolonged chilling treatment will probably rise up the germination
   percentage and should be examined in the future experiments.

   incubated at a range of constant (5-25 degrees C) and an alternating
   temperatures regime (25/10 degrees C), with 12 hours of irradiance per
   day. The results achieved at 10 degrees C were also compared with those
   obtained after a period of cold stratification at 5 degrees C for three
   months. Final seed germination ranged from ca. 28% (5 degrees C) to ca.
   72% (25/10 degrees C). A base temperature for germination (T-b) of ca. 5
   degrees C and a thermal constant for 50% germination (S) of 89.3 degrees
   Cd were identified and an optimal temperature for germination (T-o) was
   estimated to be comprised between 20 and 25 degrees C. Cold
   stratification negatively affected seed viability and germination at 10
   degrees C. Although a typical "Mediterranean germination syndrome",
   could not be detected for C. sandalioticum seeds, these results were
   coherent with those previously reported for other Mediterranean
   Lamiaceae species.

   sowing seeds at 10, 15, 20, 25 and 25/15 degrees C. In addition, seeds
   were incubated for 2 months at either 25 degrees C (summer), 5 degrees C
   (winter) or 25 degrees C for 2 months plus 2 months at 5 degrees C
   (summer followed by winter-SW), and then moved to the germination
   temperatures. Embryo measurements were taken during pre-treatments and
   germination. Experimental seed burials were carried out for two
   populations of each species. Both species dispersed in summer. The
   population of A. nugorensis occurring on rocky outcrops differed in
   phenology from both the other A. nugorensis population from riparian
   vegetation and from A. barbaricina. Both species showed
   morphophysiological seed dormancy, with<50% germination under laboratory
   conditions. All riparian populations germinated only after the SW
   pre-treatment, while the rupicolous population germinated at 25 degrees
   C, without any pre-treatment. Low germination percentages were observed
   in the experimental seed burials, suggesting the ability for both
   species to form a persistent soil seed bank.

AB Rhamnus persicifolia is an endemic small tree or shrub belonging to the
   R. cathartica group. It grows along mountainous waterways of the
   Central-Eastern Sardinia (Italy). The purpose of this study was to
   report the effects of temperature, light and pre-chilling on germination
   of R. persicifolia seeds. The applied treatments included a ran-e of
   constant temperatures (5-30 degrees C) and two alternating temperature
   regimes (15/5 and 25/10 degrees C), with two photoperiods (8 h light /
   day and darkness). In addition, the most effective germination
   temperature (25 degrees C) was repeated including a pre-chilling period
   (5 degrees C for 3 months). R. persicifolia reached maximum germination
   percentages (> 70%) at warm temperatures (>= 20 degrees C). with no
   differences between constant and alternating regimes and no response to
   light. While the pre-chilling period did not increase germination
   percentage it had a positive effect on germination rate, reducing T-50
   by more than 50%. These Studies provide new information on the seed
   biology of this endemic species and enable ex situ seed germination,
   which may prove useful for habitat restoration activities.

AB Fruit and seed morphology interact with embryo physiology and
   environmental conditions to control seed germination timing. This
   interaction plays a pivotal role in ecosystems with narrow windows for
   seedling establishment, such as the Mediterranean mountains. In this
   study, we investigated the germination responses of the secondary
   capitula (disseminules) of Gundelia tournefortii from East Mediterranean
   mountain populations. When incubated at 15 degrees C, intact capitula
   did not reach 20% of final germination, with or without the addition in
   the germination substrate of GA(3) (250 mg L-1), while extracted fruits
   reached 50% of germination, which increased to ca. 70% when treated with
   GA(3). Cold stratification enhanced final germination of the capitula at
   15 degrees C to ca. 65%, although almost half of the initially sown
   capitula germinated during the second month of stratification at 5
   degrees C. During the stratification at 5 degrees C, peak puncture force
   needed to pierce the basal part of the capitula decreased linearly and
   capitula started germinating after one month, which corresponded to a
   peak puncture force of 0.41-0.35 N. These findings highlight the
   presence of mechanical and hormonal components of physiological seed
   dormancy. The morphology of the disseminules controls seed germination
   timing, by interacting with cold winter temperatures and starting seed
   germination only in early winter. These findings not only provide new
   insights on the reproduction from seeds of this plant, but by
   highlighting high germination of cold-stratified intact capitula, can
   also support plant propagation programmes for this key wild edible
   species, very important for food security and the livelihoods of local
   communities in the East Mediterranean region.

AB The focus of this research was to evaluate genotypes for cold-tolerant
   germination from wild switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) populations
   collected in the Northeast USA. Switchgrass nurseries were established
   in 2008 and 2009 with seed collected from native stands of switchgrass
   in the Northeast USA between 1991 and 2008. Switchgrass seed harvested
   from individual genotypes was evaluated for cold-tolerant germination in
   a series of laboratory experiments. Germination assays of seed of 13
   switchgrass genotypes harvested in the fall of 2016 are the primary
   focus of this reported research. The selected genotypes were evaluated
   for cold-tolerant seed germination in three experiments, during the
   spring of 2017, fall of 2017 and spring of 2018, (with and without
   stratification) using a 10/15 degrees C regime with a 12 h photoperiod.
   Germination tests showed that several genotypes had significantly higher
   percentage germination as well as faster germination rates expressed as
   T50 (number of days required to reach 50% maximum germination) when
   compared to Cave-in-Rock, a moderately sensitive cold-tolerant
   commercial cultivar established in the original switchgrass nursery as a
   control. A final germination test was conducted to compare seed from the
   original population (no selection cycle 0), with one of the top
   performing cold-tolerant germination genotypes, and a commercial
   cultivar, 'Espresso', developed for low seed dormancy and low
   temperature germination. In this test, the selected genotype had
   significantly higher percentage germination in the stratified treatment
   and was not significantly different than Espresso in the non-stratified
   test. These data indicate successful selection for cold-tolerant
   germination in switchgrass genotypes from native germplasm collected in
   the Northeast USA.

   tropical wild sp.), (c) S. leiocladum (a wild perennial growing in
   summer at 1000 m alt.) and (d) barley cv. Abyssinian at various temp. is
   presented. Initial germination, seedling respiration and mesocotyl
   extension declined as temp. was reduced from 24 to 8 deg C, with
   greatest and least effect in (c) and (d), resp. Arrhenius plots for all
   3 responses were linear above and below a break at about 12 deg with
   differences less marked in (d) than in the sorghums. Slopes of
   regressions as measured by temp. coeff. (Q10) were greater in sorghums
   than in (d), especially below the transition temp. Very large increases
   in Q10 values below 12 deg in the most chill-sensitive spp. indicated
   very high activation energies and helped to explain poor germination and
   low growth rates at those temp. Storing imbibed seed of (a) at 8 deg for
   periods up to 20 days resulted in a small but insignificant delay in
   subsequent germination rate, whereas mesocotyl extension rates at
   favourable temp. were significantly reduced by previous storage of the
   germinated seedlings at 8 deg , suggesting that chilling stress had a
   more serious effect on actively growing than on dormant tissue. The
   amount of chlorophyll synthesized when etiolated (a) and (d) leaf tissue
   was exposed to various temp. in the range 8-26 deg for 24 h at 25 or 250
   mu E/m2s decreased with decreasing temp., but (a) at 17 deg synthesized
   chlorophyll only at the lower irradiance level. Greening in (d) was not
   affected by irradiance down to 15 deg and was higher than in (a) at
   lower temp. It appeared from electron micrographs of (a) leaf tissue
   that the failure to develop chlorophyll at the higher irradiance was due
   to arrested development of plastid membrane systems which consisted
   largely of primary lamella layers with no evidence of grana development
   and that photo-oxidation of leaf pigments may prevent the development of
   a full functional grana and stroma thylakoid system. Similar results
   were obtained with 10 chill-sensitive and chill-resistant spp.

   yeast extract at 500 mg, 150 ml coconut water (CW), 0.5 mg gibberellic
   acid, and 0.05 mg NAA/litre, was the most suitable medium for plant
   recovery. The supply of CH combined with sucrose exerted a beneficial
   effect on plant recovery and CW enhanced the effect. Hybrid plants were
   produced only from embryos at 28-33 days after pollination. Plant
   recovery rate from hybrid embryos was low and less than the embryo
   germination rate presumably due to the existence of some post-zygotic
   incompatible barriers. Hybridity of the recovered plants was confirmed
   using random amplified polymorphic DNA markers and based on their
   morphological characteristics derived from the pollen parent. Pollen
   fertility was very low in the hybrid plants compared with the parents.
   The simple method of embryo rescue proposed in this study could be used

AB Successful propagation of Selinum wallichianum, a high value medicinal
   plant of the Himalaya, requires development of methods to overcome its
   seed dormancy. While seeds collected from alpine and subalpine
   provenances spanning the range of this species were found to be viable,
   only 46.7% and 24.5%, respectively, of the seeds germinated without any
   pre-sowing treatment. Chilling (4°C) for 14 days improved the
   germination percentage of seed from both provenances compared to the
   control. Also, 100 ppm KNO3 pre-treatment for alpine and 500 ppm for
   subalpine seeds improved the percent germination significantly over the
   control. Higher concentrations of KNO3 (>500 ppm), however, reduced the
   percent germination of seeds from both provenances. Use of 100 ppm GA3
   improved the germination percentage and lowered the mean germination
   time (MGT) compared to the control for seeds from both provenances.
   Improved germination responses to chilling treatments corresponds well
   with natural conditions where S. wallichianum seeds are covered with
   snow during the winter. Response to chilling and GA3 treatment implies
   Intermediate Complex Morpho-Physiological Dormancy (MPD) of S.
   wallichianum seeds.

AB The relationship between dormancy of seeds and buds of apple (Malus x
   domestica Borkh.) might provide breeders with an early opportunity to
   select for delayed development.  Seeds of late-flowering genotypes
   require much longer exposure to chilling temperatures than those of
   early flowering genotypes, and they germinate over a much longer period.
   In three progenies that exhibit much variation for the two traits, seed
   germination time was correlated with time of leafing-out of the
   resulting seedlings, and could be used to select for delayed budbreak. 
   However, selection would be ineffective when little genetic variation
   for seed germination and budbreak is present.  Leafing-out ratings in
   the nursery in the 2nd year were highly correlated with those in the 3rd
   year, indicating that selection for late leafing in the nursery during
   the 2nd year would be more effective than selection based on seed
   dormancy, especially in progenies exhibiting little genetic variability
   for this trait.  Breeders can effectively use both relationships by
   first eliminating early germinating seeds and then eliminating early
   leafing seedlings.

AB Introduction: White Astragalus (Astragalus gossypinus Fisherr.) is one
   of the valuable plants for producing gum, which is of critical
   importance in soil conservation and the economy of the country. This
   plant is propagated by seed; its seeds are in the natural state of
   dormancy. Therefore, recognizing the factors affecting dormancy and
   creating optimal conditions for seed germination of this plant is
   necessary for the cultivation and reclamation of rangelands. This study
   was conducted with the aim of finding the best treatment for breaking
   the dormancy and improving seed germination under various chemical and
   physical treatments. Materials and Methods: The experiment was carried
   out as a factorial based on a completely randomized design with four
   replications at the gene bank of cereal and legume Lab of Ilam
   University, 2017. The factors included two levels of scarification
   chemical (with and without sulfuric acid (H2SO4) for 10 minutes), three
   levels of stratification (control, moist chilling at +4°C and dry
   chilling -20°C), potassium nitrate in two levels (zero and 1% KNO3) and
   gibberellic acid in two levels (zero and 5 ppm GA3). Germination indices
   including germination percentage, germination rate, seedling and radicle
   length, seedling fresh weight and vigor index were measured. Results:
   Initial assessment of vital indices in seed such as germination and
   primary growth showed that the simultaneous application of scarification
   by sulfuric acid and moist chilling at +4°C has the most impact on
   removing dormancy and increasing germination percentage. The highest
   germination rate was observed in moist chilling at +4°C, which was 32.19
   percent more than that of the control treatment. Scarification by
   sulfuric acid reduced the mean germination time in moist chilling at
   +4°C. Scarification by sulfuric acid increased the fresh weight of the
   seedling by 55.25 percent, compared with the control. Pre-treatments
   with potassium nitrate undre control conditions, moist chilling at +4°C
   and dry chilling at -20°C increased the fresh weight of seedlings, at
   52.66, 30.94 and 17.18 percent, respectively. Application of potassium
   nitrate increased root length by about 60.7 percent, compared with
   control. The highest radicle length (78.71 mm) was obtained when the
   seed was treated with sulphuric acid with wet chilling at 4° C for two
   weeks, which was 30 percent higher than control. The highest seedling
   length (84.88 mm) was obtained in scarification with sulfuric acid, wet
   chilling, and potassium nitrate and gibberellic acid. The highest seed
   vigor index (61.85%) was observed in the treatment of scarification with
   sulfuric acid under moist chilling, and pre-treatments of gibberellic
   acid and potassium nitrate. Conclusions: In general, it can be concluded
   that seed dormancy of Astraglus gossypinus involves both physical and
   physiological dormancy. The best treatment for removing the dormancy of
   this species seems to be scarification with sulfuric acid for 10 minutes
   puls concentrated stratification in moist chilling at +4°C for two
   weeks.

   salinity during seed germination were studied. The optimum temperatures
   for germination were 5 similar to 20 degrees C, and for germination rate
   were 15-20 degrees C, and for seedling growth were 25 degrees C.
   Germination of seeds at 35 and 40 degrees C was 5% and 0%, respectively.
   Concentrations of NaCl > 100 mM inhibited seed germination and seedling
   growth, and the sensitivity of shoot growth to salinity stress was
   greater than that of the radicle. Compared to germination at 35 degrees
   C, that of seeds pre-treated at 0 degrees C for 3 days increased by 95%,
   and dry weight of radicle and shot increased by 39 and 61%,
   respectively. After pre-treatment at 5 or 30 degrees C, the seeds were
   transferrd to 35 degrees C to germinate continuously. Germination and
   seedling growth of seeds pre-treated at 5 and 30 degrees C for different
   time also increased when they were at 35 degrees C, but these increases
   of seeds pre-treated at 0 or 5 degrees C were much greater than those of
   seeds pre-treated at 30 degrees C. Barley seeds pre-treated at 0 degrees
   C for 3 days had increased tolerance to 200 and 400 mM NaCl stress, and
   those pre-treated with 100-400 mM NaCl for 12 or 24 It had markedly
   increased tolerance to high-temperature (35 degrees C). These results
   provide a new concept for seed germination under stress environments.
   Pre-treatment at low temperature to increase tolerance to subsequent
   high temperature stress during germination will become an excellent
   model system for the study of cross tolerance.

   variation within and among several populations of the arctic-alpine
   Saxifraga aizoides from the periphery of its alpine distribution area in
   Switzerland. Flowers of S. aizoides proved to be self-compatible, but
   crossing yielded much higher seed set than selfing. Agamospermy did not
   occur. This result fits well into a general lay-our of the common
   breeding system in the genus Saxifraga. Germination of the pioneer
   species S. aizoides was fast and high in most populations and for most
   stratification and germination conditions. Nevertheless, a small,
   isolated population of this species exhibited a lower germination rate,
   possibly caused by enhanced inbreeding. Phenotypic variation, especially
   in petal colour and leaf shape, indicated considerable genetic variation
   within and among populations of S. aizoides. High germination capacity,
   successful selfing, and the possibility to maintain substantial
   intrapopulational genetic variation due to high outbreeding may play
   decisive roles in the maintenance of biogeographically outlying, relic
   populations of S. aizoides in the Swiss Plateau as well as in the
   colonization of new habitat patches.

AB The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the
   collection position of fruits from the malagueta pepper plant and seed
   quality and initial seedling development. The seeds were obtained from
   fruits collected at different positions in the canopy (C) and branches
   (R): 1 - apical, 2 - median, and 3 - basal. The following evaluations
   were made: water content, seed weight (PMS), number of seeds per
   kilogram, seed size (1ength, width and thickness), germination and
   vigor, according to the germination speed index (IVG), the average time
   of germination (TMG), root and seedling length, and the fresh and dry
   weights of seedlings 28 days after sowing. Seeds from fruits collected
   from the basal and median positions of the canopy, and base of branches
   (C2R3 and C3R3) had a higher PMS, associated with a greater seed length
   and width. These treatments also showed a higher germination percentage,
   germination speed index and lower mean germination time. Besides the
   higher vigor, seeds from fruits collected in the basal region (C3R3)
   show greater plant development for root length and fresh and dry weight
   of the seedlings.

AB Northern red oak (Quercus rubra) acorns from 50 families representing 10
   provenances of Quebec, Ontario and Vermont were collected with the aim
   of establishing provenance progeny tests in Quebec and also evaluating
   the effect of acorn morphology (mass, volume and density), of the
   pre-germination of acorns in cold storage (during stratification) and of
   the genotype of mother-plant on growth of the seedlings in containers
   over two years under a cold frame. As expected, there was a strong
   correlation between acorn mass and volume, but no relation was found
   between the parameters evaluated and geographical or ecological location
   of the provenances. Pre-germination rate varied greatly among
   provenances as well as among families within provenances, but it was not
   possible to impute, without any reasonable doubt, this variation to the
   genotype of the mother-plant or to the varying collection conditions
   between trees and provenances. Besides, there was no relation between
   acorn morphology and pre-germination rate. The final germination rate of
   the acorns after six weeks in the containers was also widely variable
   among and within provenances, but was homogeneous for a specific acorn
   lot (or family); this supports the theory that the observed
   heterogeneity in the nurseries is due to the genetic diversity of the
   material. At the end of the first growing season, height growth of the
   seedlings was significantly influenced by the genotype; this tendency
   persisted till the end of the second growing season. The genotype also
   significatively influenced the diameter, but this was only true at the
   end of the second year. Furthermore, provenances showing a high
   proportion of pre-germinated acorns in cold storage also had a high rate
   of germination after six weeks in containers, they germinated faster,
   the germination of the acorns in a lot was more synchronized and the
   seedlings thus produced were of better quality. There was no significant
   relation between acorn volume (and density) and seedling development
   after two years in containers. However, it was noted that seedling
   height and diameter after two years in the nursery was related to the
   acorn mass.

AB Understanding seed germination biology and the dynamics of seed dormancy
   is essential to developing reliable germination techniques. This paper
   presents some new data and reviews recent findings from germination
   studies on Australian species, with respect to the role of temperature
   and moisture in the control of dormancy and germination. A seed-burial
   experiment was conducted over a 1-year period (January-December) with
   seeds of Acanthocarpus preissii Lehm., Astroloma xerophyllum (DC.)
   Sond., Gahnia grandis (Labill.) S.T.Blake, Goodenia scaevolina F.Muell.
   and Tersonia cyathiflora (Fenzl) J.W.Green to determine the fluctuations
   in temperature and moisture seeds naturally experience in the buried
   environment. All seeds became hydrated during autumn (March) while soil
   temperatures were > 15 degrees C, suggestive of a period of warm
   stratification before the onset of cooler winter temperatures
   appropriate for germination. Evidence of rapid wetting and drying of
   seeds in the soil environment was also present. Laboratory experiments
   testing stratification as a means for dormancy loss showed that several
   weeks of warm stratification at 26/13 degrees C or 33/18 degrees C
   promoted germination of Lomandra preissii (Endl.) Ewart, Marianthus
   bicolor (Putt.) F.Muell. and Xyris lanata R.Br. seeds. X. lanata seeds
   also responded to several weeks of cold stratification at 5 degrees C.
   By integrating this new data with other published data on germination of
   Australian species, diagrammatic models of germination timing, dormancy
   syndromes and propagation strategies for temperate Australian species
   are presented as working hypotheses to help direct future research.

AB Seeds of Purshia tridentata, a shrub of semi-arid North America, require
   chilling to become non-dormant. Using seeds produced from controlled
   crosses in a common garden, we examined effects of ovule parent, pollen
   parent, and year of production on germination percentage in response to
   chilling for 2 weeks at 2 degrees C. Differences among ovule parents
   accounted for most of the variance in chilling response, and these
   differences (2 to 83% germination) were consistent across years.
   Differences among pollen parents were also significant, producing a two-
   to five-fold difference in mean germination percentage. Differences
   among years were significant but small. Ovule parent by par interactions
   Showed that among-year variation in ripening environment did not affect
   ovule parents equally. There was no significant pollen parent by year
   interaction, suggesting that the effect of maturation environment was
   mediated through maternal tissues. In reciprocal crosses, two plants
   that showed contrasting dormancy levels as ovule parents produced seeds
   with similar dormancy as pollen parents, indicating that the genetic
   difference between them was at the testa level. Two plants that produced
   seeds with contrasting dormancy as pollen parents showed a similar but
   stronger pattern of contrast as ovule parents, showing that the genetic
   difference between them was at both embryo and endosperm or testa level.
   Testa or endosperm genotype was primarily responsible for chilling
   response of intact seeds, while embryo genotype affected chilling
   response and also exercised primary control over low temperature
   germination rate, whether of excised embryos or of intact seeds.

AB Regulation of seed germination timing is an important component of
   population persistence, especially for short-lived plants in seasonal
   environments with unpredictable year-to-year weather variation. Seed
   germination patterns were examined in the laboratory for seeds from 135
   populations belonging to 38 species and 13 sections of the genus
   Penstemon (Scrophulariaceae), from habitats ranging from warm desert to
   alpine tundra. Seeds of most species were dormant at dispersal and
   required a period of moist chilling to become germinable. Response to
   chilling was related to probable chilling duration at the collection
   site. Populations from habitats with severe winters produced seeds with
   long chilling requirements, while those from habitats with mild winters
   produced seeds with short chilling requirements. Populations from
   midelevation habitats produced seeds with intermediate chilling
   requirements but with a sizeable fraction whose dormancy was not broken
   by chilling of any length. Another pattern observed mostly in warm
   desert populations was little primary dormancy at autumn temperatures
   combined with induction of a fraction into secondary dormancy by short
   chilling. Species with a wide habitat range included populations with
   contrasting germination patterns. Parallel habitat-correlated patterns
   were observed in different sections. Most species showed germination
   patterns that combined predictive mechanisms with potential for
   carryover of a persistent seed bank. Results of common garden
   experiments suggested that germination differences had a strong genetic
   basis both among populations and among plants in a population. Adaptive
   radiation in the genus Penstemon has thus included the evolution of
   habitat-specific germination timing strategies in multiple lineages
   within the genus.

AB We studied seed germination responses of 41 collections of Leymus
   cinereus (basin wildrye), a native perennial bunchgrass widely
   distributed in western North America. Collections made in 1987 and 1988
   were largely nondormant in midautumn but relatively slow to germinate at
   optimal temperatures (mean germination time 6-16 d). Seeds germinated
   more quickly after a 2-wk chilling pretreatment (mean germination time
   2-11 d). Mean germination time under conditions simulating prolonged
   snowpack (1 degrees C) varied among collections from 6 to 12 wk and was
   negatively correlated with mean January temperature at the collection
   site. In dry-afterripening experiments with four 1992 collections, seeds
   showed only minor change in germination rate and percentage after time
   in dry storage, unlike seeds of Bromus tectorum (cheatgrass) and Elymus
   elymoides (squirreltail), which are facultatively fall-emerging Field
   retrieval studies showed that L. cinereus seeds did not germinate in
   autumn even under conditions that triggered complete germination of B.
   tectorum and E. elymoides. Thus L. cinereus is primarily a
   spring-emerging species even though its seeds are mostly nondormant at
   dispersal. Its failure to germinate more quickly as a consequence of
   time in dry storage protects it from fall emergence under most weather
   scenarios. Timing of germination under snowpack is keyed to
   site-specific variation in snowpack duration, ensuring rapid emergence
   in very early spring. These results show the importance of rate as a
   mechanism that regulates germination phenology under semiarid
   conditions.

AB Members of Penstemon Section Glabri are common perennial herbs in
   habitats from desert shrublands to subalpine meadows throughout the
   Intermountain West. Germination response to moist chilling was evaluated
   for 36 populations belonging to 13 species within the section. Eleven
   species (P. cyananthus, P. cyaneus, P. cyanocaulis, P. fremontii, P.
   laevis, P. leiophyllus, P. perpulcher, P. scariosus, P. speciosus, P.
   strictus and P. subglaber) had seeds that were largely dormant at
   harvest and responded positively to chilling, whereas two (P. ammophilus
   and P. commarhenus) had seeds that were largely nondormant. The
   proportion of seeds that could be rendered nondormant through chilling
   varied among species, populations and years of collection; many middle
   elevation collections contained a large fraction nonresponsive to chill.
   Most chill-responsive seeds germinated during prolonged chilling. Across
   species, germination rate during chilling was significantly correlated
   with mean January temperature at the collection site for each of 3 yr of
   collection, i.e., collections from habitats with warmer winters
   germinated more quickly in the cold than those from sites with colder
   winters. Similarly, the chilling period needed for maximal postchilling
   germination increased as collection site winter temperature decreased.
   Experiments with common garden-grown seeds of six of the species showed
   that patterns characteristic of wild-collected seeds persisted in the
   garden, indicating a probable genetic basis for the differences.
   Adaptive radiation in Penstemon Section Glabri has resulted in evolution
   of population-level germination syndromes that maximize the probability
   of establishment in a range of specific habitats.

   vigor index at 17 degrees C among the 13 materials (P<0.05), which also
   significantly correlated to the chilling tolerance. At seedling stage,
   the physiology among the materials after treated at 4 degrees C for 2
   days had obvious difference. Chilling injury index had significant
   correlation with the survival rate after recovery, but less correlation
   with the soluble protein (SP) content, electric conductivity (EC), and

   population was characterized using mycelial compatibility group (MCG)
   typing. No response was observed for isolates conditioned at 4 degrees C
   at any time period, indicating that chilling is not a preconditioning
   requirement for these isolates. Sclerotia required preconditioning for a
   minimum of 60 days before any significant increase in germination
   occurred, with no further increases in germination recorded in response
   to longer conditioning after 60 days. The highest germination was
   observed in sclerotia conditioned at 50 degrees C. The MCG results
   indicated significant diversity within and between populations,
   suggesting local adaptation to different environments as well as
   ensuring the ability to respond to seasonal variation between years.

AB Banksia saxicola A. S. George is a rare species with a disjunct
   distribution, at Wilsons Promontory National Park and the Grampians
   National Park, Victoria. Phenetic classification and ordination analyses
   using 13 leaf, inflorescence and infructescence characters, indicated
   that population differences are present but individual plants do not
   exclusively group into geographically isolated populations. Plants from
   Mt William (Grampians) are different from those at Wilsons Promontory,
   but those from Mt Rosea (Grampians) overlap with both of these
   populations. Leaf flavonoid analysis revealed minor differences between
   Grampians and Wilsons Promontory populations, with the latter being
   intermediate between B. integrifolia and Grampians B. saxicola.
   Germination of seed extracted from 1, 2-3 and gt 3 year old
   infructescences varied from 15-35% at 50 days. Seed from Wilsons
   Promontory had the highest germination rate. Cold stratification of seed
   only promoted germination of seed gt 3 years of age from Mt William.
   Banksia saxicola, from Wilsons Promontory, had the highest level of
   serotiny, although more seed was stored per plant at Mt William due to
   greater fecundity. Granivory of canopy stored seed was highest at
   Wilsons Promontory. At the Grampians, B. saxicola is locally common,
   plants are generally healthy, and spontaneous seed release together with
   favourable environmental conditions, have allowed populations to
   regenerate in the absence of fire. At Wilsons Promontory, however,
   plants are less abundant, and with no regeneration in the last 19 years
   the population is aging. For continued existence of B. saxicola at
   Wilsons Promontory, conservation management strategies need to include
   burning.

AB In a future warmer subarctic climate, the soil temperatures experienced
   by dispersed seeds are likely to increase during summer but may decrease
   during winter due to expected changes in snow depth, duration and
   quality. Because little is known about the dormancy-breaking and
   germination requirements of subarctic species, how warming may influence
   the timing and level of germination in these species was examined.
   Under controlled conditions, how colder winter and warmer summer soil
   temperatures influenced germination was tested in 23 subarctic species.
   The cold stratification and warm incubation temperatures were derived
   from real soil temperature measurements in subarctic tundra and the
   temperatures were gradually changed over time to simulate different
   months of the year.
   Moderate summer warming (+2 center dot 5 degrees C) substantially
   accelerated germination in all but four species but did not affect
   germination percentages. Optimum germination temperatures (20/10 degrees
   C) further decreased germination time and increased germination
   percentages in three species. Colder winter soil temperatures delayed
   the germination in ten species and decreased the germination percentage
   in four species, whereas the opposite was found in Silene acaulis. In
   most species, the combined effect of a reduced snow cover and summer
   warming resulted in earlier germination and thus a longer first growing
   season, which improves the chance of seedling survival. In particular
   the recruitment of (dwarf) shrubs (Vaccinium myrtillus, V. vitis-idaea,
   Betula nana), trees (Alnus incana, Betula pubescens) and grasses
   (Calamagrostis lapponica, C. purpurea) is likely to benefit from a
   warmer subarctic climate.
   Seedling establishment is expected to improve in a future warmer
   subarctic climate, mainly by considerably earlier germination. The
   magnitudes of the responses are species-specific, which should be taken
   into account when modelling population growth and migration of subarctic
   species.

AB The purpose of this study was to show the effect of cold-stratification,
   gibberellic acid and potassium nitrate on seed germination of yellow
   gentian (Gentiana lutea L.). The seeds of natural yellow gentian
   populations of the Albanian Alps (Kosovo) were collected in September
   2010. Seeds placed in filter paper (plastic bag) and in mixture of
   sand-soil were cold-stratified (21°C) for 72 days. The effect of
   different concentrations of gibberellic acid (250, 500 and 1000 ppm GA3)
   and potassium nitrate (0.1, 0.2 and 0.3% KNO3) in final germination
   percentage (FGP), mean germination time (MGT) and germination index (GI)
   in non-stratified and stratified seeds were examined. Seeds stratified
   in filter paper and treated with 1000 ppm GA3 and 0.1% KNO3 showed
   significantly higher percentage of germination (FGP and GI), while seeds
   stratified in mixture of sand-soil showed the highest values of FGP and
   GI in treatments with 500 ppm GA3 and different concentrations of KNO3.
   The cold-stratification and GA3 treatments of yellow gentian seeds are
   suitable for the higher percentage of germinations.

AB A tissue culture protocol was developed that increased the germination
   percentage and decreased the lag time to germination for strawberry
   (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) achenes.  This technique involved cutting
   surface-sterilized achenes across the embryo axis then placing the shoot
   apex/radicle-containing sections on semisolid Murashige and Skoog medium
   lacking hormones.  Cut achenes began germinating 5 days after culture
   and achieved maximum germination (97% to 100%) in less than 2 weeks,
   compared to whole achenes, which began to germinate 7 to 10 days after
   sowing and required more than 7 weeks for maximum germination (< 50%). 
   Enhanced germination of cut achenes was a general phenomenon since
   achenes from 231 hybrid crosses responded similarly.  Following
   placement on culture medium, cut achenes could be stored up to 8 weeks
   at 4C then removed to 27C, where germination and seedling development
   occurred at percentages and rates comparable to freshly cut achenes. 
   Achenes did not require stratification before cutting to exhibit
   increased germination.  Nearly 100% of the achenes from freshly
   harvested red-ripe, pink, and white strawberries germinated after
   cutting and culture, although cut achenes from white and pink berries
   germinated more slowly than those from red-ripe berries.  Achenes from
   green berries, whether whole or cut, did not germinate.  This method of
   "embryo rescue" could be used to generate more seedlings from poorly
   germinating hybrid crosses, would considerably decrease the time from
   sowing to seedling production compared to traditional means, and would
   produce seedlings of uniform age for subsequent field evaluation.

AB Background: Ginseng, officially known as Panax ginseng Meyer, has been
   traditionally used as a medicinal herb, particularly in Asia. Ginseng is
   propagated from seeds; however, seed germination is challenging,
   especially in its natural environment on farms. The seeds typically
   exhibit morphophysiological dormancy and require release from both
   morphological and physiological dormancy before germination. Although
   some studies have proposed methods for increasing seed germination
   rates, the underlying mechanisms of its dormancy release process remain
   unclear. Here, we investigated metabolic alterations during dehiscence
   in P. ginseng to determine their potential roles in dormancy release.
   Methods: We compared the ginseng seed metabolome before and after
   dehiscence and the ginsenoside and phytosterol compositions of the seeds
   in both periods in the presence of related enzymes. Results: After seed
   dehiscence, the sugar, amino acid, and squalene concentrations were
   significantly altered, phytosterols associated with the stigmasterol
   biosynthesis pathway were increased, while ginsenoside and
   brassinosteroid levels were not significantly altered. In addition,
   squalene epoxidase, cycloartenol synthase, 24-methylenesterol
   C-methyltransferase, and the stigmasterol biosynthesis pathway were
   activated. Conclusion: Overall, our findings suggest that morphological
   activities that facilitate ginseng seed growth are the primary phenomena
   occurring during the dehiscence process. This study improves the
   understanding of P. ginseng germination processes and promotes further
   research of its germination and cultivation. (c) 2021 The Korean Society

AB Cypripedium macranthos is a wild orchid that is becoming endangered.
   Efficient methods for its propagation from seed, which is indispensable
   for conservation, production and breeding, have not been reported. The
   effects of sodium and calcium hypochlorite, pre-chilling and cytokinins
   on the germination of seeds of Cypripedium macranthos Swartz were
   examined. The duration of treatment with a solution of hypochlorite
   prior to sowing was one of the critical factors that affected
   germination. Approximately 70% of seeds that had been treated with
   either a solution of NaClO that contained 0.5% available chlorine for 60
   min or with one of Ca(ClO)(2) with 3.2% available chlorine for 7 h,
   germinated after 3 months of culture at 20 degrees C, subsequent to 2
   months chilling at 4 degrees C. Chilling seeds at 4 degrees C prior to
   culture at 20 degrees C was another factor that stimulated germination.
   Even chilling for 2 weeks had a promotive effect on germination, and
   chilling for 2 months enhanced it most effectively: the frequency of
   germination was 67% after 3 months of culture at 20 degrees C. However,
   the promotive effects of chilling on germination were reduced by holding
   seeds at 20 degrees C for 3 and 6 weeks prior to chilling treatment.
   Germination of 58-70% was achieved by the addition of 1 mu M cytokinin
   to the medium, while the frequency was only 17% in cytokinin-free
   medium. We report a reproducible and efficient method for enhancing seed
   germination of C. macranthos, which involves treatment with hypochlorite
   prior to sowing, and the combination of chilling at 4 degrees C prior to
   germination and exposure to a cytokinin.

AB False jagged-chickweed (Lepyrodidis holosteoides (C.A. Mey.) Fenzl ex
   Fisch. & C.A. Mey.) is an invasive weed species distributed in many
   regions of Iran. Scientific knowledge about the biology and ecology of
   false jagged-chickweed is rare. In a series of laboratory experiments,
   the effect of chilling treatments, potassium nitrate (KNO3), gibberellic
   acid (GA(3)), concentrations, temperature regimes, and sowing depths on
   seed germination and breaking seed dormancy of false jagged-chickweed
   was studied. In two field experiments the phenology of false
   jagged-chickweed and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) was also compared.
   Chilling treatment for 15 days, a KNO3 concentration of 30 mu molar and
   a GA(3) concentration of 144 mu molar increased germination percentage
   and germination rate. However, chilling treatment for 15 days did not
   increase germination rate as well as the KNO 3 and GA(3) treatments. A
   quadratic polynomial model predicted that the optimum temperature giving
   the maximum germination percentage was 22 degrees C. Seedlings emerged
   in a range of sowing depths from 0 to 8 cm, while no seedling emergence
   occurred at sowing depths greater than 10 cm. Based on a Gaussian model,
   the optimum sowing depth was predicted to be 3.9 cm. False
   jagged-chickweed required higher growing degree days (GDD) for seedling
   emergence than winter wheat, while the flowering stage of false
   jagged-chickweed occurred earlier than winter wheat. Results achieved in
   the present study are of interest not only for studying other life cycle
   aspects of this species but also as basic information for developing
   management strategies.

   treatment of seeds at 4°C (before planting) for 15, 30, and 45 days as
   it was applied separately to determine the best concentration and the
   best time. In the second experiment, the best results obtained from the
   first experiment included treatment of stratification (30 and 45 days of
   stratification) and seaweed extract (125 and 250 ml L-1) combined based
   on a factorial experiment in five replications on seed germination of
   two cultivars of Lisianthus was examined. The results showed that the
   percentage and speed of final germination, and the average daily
   germination in Arena cultivar was higher than Mariachi cultivar. With
   the increase of stratification days, the percentage of final germination
   and the average daily germination had an increasing trend. The 30-day
   stratification treatment and 125 ml and 250 ml of seaweed extract
   resulted in the highest final germination rate and the lowest average
   germination time. Interaction of stratification and seaweed extract had
   a higher average daily germination than the control treatment. The use
   of seaweed extract had a positive effect on germination indices compared
   to the control. With the increasing concentration of seaweed extract,
   the need for stratification decreased.

AB Introduction: In order to take more advantage of the spring growing
   season, the mechanisms of germination of spring plants are of great
   importance at temperatures lower than the optimum temperature. Since one
   of the ways to reduce damage due to low temperature is enhancing the
   seedling antioxidant system, in this study the effects of salicylic acid
   and gibberellin on germination and antioxidant system of pumpkin
   (Cucurbita pepo) seeds were investigated under low temperatures.
   Materials and Methods: A factorial experiment including four
   concentrations of gibberellin (0, 250, 350 and 450 mg/L), four
   concentrations of salicylic acid (0, 0.5, 1 and 1.5 mM) and three
   temperature levels (8, 11 and 14°C) was performed with a completely
   randomized design within controlled conditions and six replications at
   Shahrekord University in 2017. The seeds were immersed in containers
   containing solutions of 0, 250, 350 and 450 mg/L of gibberellin and
   solutions with 0, 0.5, 1, and 1.5 mM salicylic acid, were placed in a
   growth chamber for 24 h under dark conditions at 15°C. Then the seeds
   were washed at the desired temperatures, and the germination was
   recorded every 24 hours based on the 2 mm of radicle length. At the end
   of the eighth day, after the separation of normal and abnormal
   seedlings, 20 normal seedlings were selected from each petri dish.
   Following that, the germination rate, germination percentage, soluble
   protein, malondialdehyde, superoxide dismutase, guiacol peroxide enzyme,
   and catalase enzyme were measured. Comparison of means was conducted by
   the least significant difference test at the 0.05 probability level.
   Results: The results showed that none of the treatments used at 8°C
   helped germination of the plant and, therefore, 8°C treatment was
   removed from the experiment. At the temperature of 11°C, the use of
   salicylic acid 1 mM and at 14°C, the use of gibberellin 350 mg/L showed
   the maximum germination rate and germination percentage, compared with
   the control. At 11°C, the activity of antioxidant enzymes was more
   affected by gibberellin hormone so that the highest activity of
   superoxide dismutase enzyme was observed in 350 mg/L and the highest
   activity of catalase and guaiacol peroxidase enzymes and the lowest
   amount of soluble protein were observed in gibberellin 250 mg/L. The
   salicylic acid hormone was more successful at 14°C. The salicylic acid
   1.5 mM increased the activity of superoxide dismutase enzyme; and
   salicylic acid 0.5 mM increased the activity of catalase and salicylic
   acid 1 mM improved the activity of guiacol peroxidase. This hormone also
   succeeded in reducing the amount of soluble protein. Conclusion: In this
   experiment, seedling tolerance at low temperatures was confirmed by
   gibberellin and salicylic acid treatments. It is generally concluded
   that the use of gibberellin and salicylic acid increases the activity of
   antioxidant enzymes and, as a result, makes pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo)
   seedlings tolerant to low-temperature stress, and thus, can ameliorate
   the effect of possible chilling on growth of this crop at the beginning
   of the season.

AB Seed germination in the after-ripening period was studied, taking into
   consideration embryo development. The embryo was small and
   underdeveloped after shedding and grew larger and developed as the time
   of postharvest advanced. The time required for the germination decreased
   as the storage period increased. The storage of seeds by stratification
   raised the germination capacity and reduced the time required to
   germinate. The exposure of the seeds to low temperature brought about a
   similar effect. Stratification was particularly effective on embryo
   development. The RNA content and amylase activity of seeds were lowest
   immediately after shedding and gradually increased as after-ripening
   period progressed; RNA content was highest 5 mo. later. The exposure of
   seeds to low temperature increased amylase activity, but not their RNA
   content. The irregularity in the seed germination of this medicinal
   plant is mostly attributable to the after-ripening period for seed
   maturation and autoinhibitors. The germination inhibitors localized in
   the seed coat consume O2 and create an anaerobic condition in the
   dormant seeds resulting in a low activity of anaerobic respiration.
   Inhibitors presumably interfere in germination metabolism rather than
   respiration; their potent nature is to diminish the amylase activity of
   B. falcatum seeds even at low concentration.

   distilled water (control), sulfuric acid (98% for 2, 3 and 4 minutes),
   potassium nitrate (3%for 3, 4 and 7 days), hydrogen peroxide (30% for 2,
   3 and 4 minutes) and scarification with sandpaper and prechilling (for
   1, 2 and 3 weeks). Germination percent, germination rate, length and dry
   weight of epicotyl, length and dry weight of radicle, seedling total dry
   weight and vigor index were evaluated for Myagrum seed. Results showed
   that the most germination percent was related to hydrogen peroxide
   treatment for3 minutes (91%) and scarification with a chilling for 3
   weeks (84%) and the lowest germination percent was observed in sulfuric
   acid treatment. The results of treatment group comparisons also showed
   that using hydrogen peroxide had the greatest impact on seed germination
   of Myagrum. The most germination rate (4.5) and epicotyl dry weight (1.6
   g) was observed in hydrogen peroxide for 3 minutes. The most epicotyl
   length (22.7 mm), radicle length (36.6 mm), radicle dry weight (1.1 g),
   seedling dry weight (2.5 gr) and vigor index (49.9) were related to seed
   scarification along with chilling for 3 weeks. Our results also indicted
   that application of sulfuric acid due to extreme damage onembryo leaded
   to death of Myagrum seed. It seems that lack of appropriate germination
   in Myagrum seed could be due to embryo physiological factors because all
   evaluated treatments had more impact on seed metabolic and harmonic

   occurred under natural conditions during winter and early spring, which
   caused increases in seed germination of plants. It was also found that
   increase in the chilling period significantly improved the seed
   germination characteristics of N. glomerulosa. The treatment with

AB Dracocephalum kotschyi Boiss. is a herbaceous wild medicinal plant
   native to Iran. Due to high degree of seed dormancy, seeds always show a
   low germination rate. In this study, different treatments were compared
   to overcome seed dormancy. Different chemical scarifications, including
   dilution in concentrated sulfuric acid for 15 minutes, culturing seeds
   in gibberelic acid, 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and Kinetin, chilling at
   4°C for 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks and 25°C for 4 weeks were studied. Results
   showed that chemical scarification treatment using sulfuric acid for 15
   minutes and applications of BAP hormone were efficient in promoting seed
   germination.

   low; however, propagation does depend in some cases on seeds. In
   laboratory tests on germination, a 2% solution of potassium nitrate
   increased germination of 5-month old seeds. Some increase in germination
   also occurred when seeds, pre-chilled for 7 days, were treated with
   distilled water; pre-chilling only affected germination of
   nitrate-treated seeds during the first week. Temps. alternating daily
   between 20 deg and 35 deg C produced a higher germination rate than
   temps. alternating between 20 deg and 30 deg C, whether seeds were
   pre-chilled or not, but different temps. did not affect potassium
   nitrate-treated seeds. There was a 2% to 4% variation in germination of

   stratification (8°C) (WCS) and wet, cold stratification followed by wet,
   warm stratification (25°C) (WCS+WWS) were evaluated for 15, 30 and 45
   days for each treatment. After the application of these treatments,
   germination was tested in growth chambers at 30 and 35°C to determine
   the temperature effect on germination. The seeds had a higher
   germination rate (GR) and mean velocity of germination (MVG) with the
   application of WCS for 45 days at 35°C with a GR of 65.6%. The seeds
   kept at 30°C germinated later and showed a lower GR and MVG than
   germination at 35°C. Based on these results, it can be concluded that
   the temperature of 35°C improved the germination of sugar apple seeds.
   The response of sugar apple seeds to stratification (WCS and WCS+WWS)
   could indicate the presence of morpho-physiological dormancy.

AB The effects of water temperature and bottom sediment type were studied
   on seed dormancy and germination of Zostera japonica Ascherson &
   Graebner in mesocosm. To test whether the germination rate is affected
   by cold stratification, seeds were divided into two groups: those
   exposed to cold (7 degrees C) and those left untreated (23-15 degrees
   C). Additionally, to mimic tidal variation, we used five tidal depth
   treatments for germination experiments in mesocosm. In mesocosm tanks,
   there was a wide range of daily fluctuating temperature at datum line
   +40 cm (17-25 degrees C), DL +20 cm (15 degrees C), and D.L +0 cm (4-7
   degrees C). In contrast, the maximum temperature range at D.L -20 cm and
   -40 cm was narrow (5-6 degrees C). In the no cold stratification group,
   the maximum germination rates on sandy, muddy sand, and muddy bottom
   sediment were 3%, 11%, and 3%, respectively. In the cold stratification
   group (7 degrees C), the maximum germination rates were 40%, 53%, and
   54%, respectively. First germination was observed 36 0 days and 43 6
   days after the start of the germination experiment in the cold
   stratification group and the no cold stratification group, respectively.
   Bottom sediment type and tidal level did not affect seed germination in
   the both stratification group. Cold stratification strongly increases
   germination in all sediment types tested and under varying temperature
   regimes and at different tidal levels. We also tested whether seed
   germination is affected by daily fluctuations in temperature (10 degrees
   C constant, 15 degrees C/10 degrees C, and 20 degrees C/10 degrees C
   were compared) in an indoor incubator. Forty-two days after being sown,
   the maximum seedling emergence rates in the three groups were 3 +/- 5%,
   21 +/- 7%, and 42 +/- 26%, respectively. At 20 degrees C/10 degrees C,
   first germination was observed 11 days after the start of incubation,
   the germination rate rose sharply after 18 day of incubation, and then
   it leveled off after 32-42 days of incubation. In the no cold
   stratification group, seed germination was not observed in any of the
   three treatments. This finding suggests that the breaking of seed
   dormancy and germination of Z. japonica seeds are determined strongly by
   cold temperature and daily fluctuations of temperature, respectively.

AB Seeds from two Fagus sylvatica seed lots were moist chilled (prechilled)
   at restricted moisture content (33% mc) for, respectively, 10 and 16
   weeks. After prechilling, seeds were fully imbibed and germinated at 5
   and 15degreesC in solutions of ethephon, GA(3), paclobutrazol or
   destilled water (control). Germination, i.e. radicle protrusion, was
   monitored after different durations of prechilling, i.e. at different
   seed dormancy levels. In F. sylvatica seeds, GA(3)-application exerted a
   stronger dormancy alleviating effect than that achieved by
   ethephon-application, but it could not fully substitute for the cold
   requirement. No effect of GA(3) was achieved in non-dormant seeds.
   Ethephon reduced dormancy and significantly stimulated germination rate
   of dormant as well as non-dormant seeds. Paclobutrazol prolonged the
   cold requirement but, like GA(3), had no effect in non-dormant seeds.
   Picea sitchensis seeds, exhibiting conditional dormancy, were imbibed in
   ethephon, GA(3) and paclobutrazol subsequent to 0, 7, 14 or 21 days of
   prechilling. No effect was observed of GA(3) at any of the
   concentrations used at either 15 or 20degreesC. On the contrary,
   paclobutrazol delayed P. sitchensis seed germination after 0, 7 and 14
   days prechill. Subsequent to 21 days prechill, paclobutrazol did not
   delay germination at 15degreesC and only slightly delayed it at
   20degreesC. A portion of P. sitchensis seeds were imbibed and prechilled
   in paclobutrazol for 14 days and subsequently imbibed and germinated in
   water at 15degreesC. Germination of these seeds did not differ from
   control seeds, prechilled 14 days in water, suggesting that gibberellin
   biosynthesis is more crucial for radicle protrusion when imbibed at
   temperatures suitable for germination. Like GA(3), ethephon showed no
   effect on germination of P. sitchensis seeds.

AB In order to evaluate seed source and pre-treatment hydrogen peroxide on
   the seed germination characters of Fagus orientalis Lipsky, some seeds
   were collected from three altitudes (600, 1200, 1800 m a.s.l.) in Vaz
   forests of Noor city (north of Iran). Following soaking in hydrogen
   peroxide (20 and 40 minutes) seeds were stratified together with the
   control in moist sand and maintained in refrigerator for 120 days.
   Germination initiation was recorded every week. The results showed that
   seed dormancy of 1800 m elevation took 60 days long which was longer
   than the other two seed sources. Seed source significantly affected seed
   germination, whereas seed germination rate, mean daily germination and
   germination speed increased with increase in altitude. Hydrogen peroxide
   did not increase seed germination as well as daily germination mean.
   This research revealed that to break dormancy of higher elevations seed,
   the longer stratification period is required. Considering applying
   stratification, control seeds of higher elevations had higher
   germination rate compared to the seeds of lower elevation. Thus it is
   advised to use seeds from higher elevations for seedling production in
   mountain nurseries and seed sowing or seed broadcasting for restoration
   of deforested or non-regenerated areas of Caspian mountain forests.

AB Beechnuts are deeply dormant and require long cold prechilling before
   they germinate (one to three months). The methodology of pretreatment
   without medium at controlled moisture content applied before or after
   storage is the best method to take into account the dormancy and the
   heterogeneity within a seedlot (consequence of the genetic variability).
   It allows a very fast and grouped seedling emergence in the nursery.
   However, this long prechilling often damages older, less vigorous
   seedlots. The effect of chemical treatments on dormancy breaking, in
   particular growth regulators, as a means of shortening the treatment,
   has been studied. In previous experiments ethephon was shown to strongly
   stimulate percentage and germination rate of freshly collected beechnuts
   and to reduce the duration of the cold requirement by half in comparison
   with the classical pretreatment which needs 4 to 20 weeks. In the
   present study ethephon+short prechilling (3 weeks) strongly stimulates
   germination and seedling emergence of beechnuts stored for 3 years at
   either 7 or 9% moisture content. It avoids the viability loss of
   less-vigorous beech seeds during longer prechilling (5 weeks) and allows
   restoring the initial potential of the seedlots. No significant effect
   of storage moisture content is observed on seedling emergence when seeds
   are short-prechilled with ethephon. Thus, ethephon used in association
   with short cold treatment opens new prospects for dormancy breaking
   particularly in nurseries where short prechilling are preferred.

   mixing of milieu with digestive fluids (MIX)) in the reconstructed GI
   tract in patients after partial gastrectomy. (Methods) We studied 19
   patients who had had partial gastrectomy between 1991 and 2002 due to
   gastric neoplasm (postoperative month= 7-91 Mo). After over night
   fasting, patients were given a liquid meal (100 cc, 100 Cal) with 99mTc
   and received an iv infusion with 111In for GE-L/hepatobiliary dual
   scintigraphy. GE-L was assessed by T50% of test meal. Patients were
   classified into rapid, normal, or delayed GE-L group. MIX was
   graphically assessed in the intestinal phase as an overlap of both
   radioactive markers (99mTc and 111In). Patients were classified into two
   groups: poor or well MIX. Nutritional status was assessed by serum total
   cholesterol (TC, mg/dl) and albumin (Alb, g/dl) before and after
   surgery. We compared TC and Alb among the groups, and also before and
   after operation in each group. (Results) TC and Alb in each group are
   shown in the table and tend to be lower in rapid GE-L with poor MIX
   group (mean+SEM). Compared with preoperative state, TC and Alb in
   postoperative state significantly dropped in the rapid GE-L group
   (particularly poor MIX group) (p<0.05). (Conclusion) Postprandial
   dynamics after gastrectomy was associated with long-term nutritional
   status. Particularly, the subjects with rapid gastric emptying and poor
   mixing of milieu with digestive fluids tend to have more severe
   malnutrition. This diagnosis must be considered in patients with
   long-term refractory malnutrition after gastrectomy. Evaluation of
   gastric emptying and mixing by dual scintigraphy may be useful in
   predicting development of long-term malnutrition..

AB This paper proposed an orthogonal design L-27(3(13)) with four
   factors(seeds shucked off pericarp, dipped in water, GA(3) treatment,
   6-BA treatment and stratification)and three levels based on the dormancy
   of Tilia amurensis seed. The optimal way for quikly breaking seed
   dormancy was obtained. That was: 1)shucking off the pericarp; 2)scalding
   seeds for 2s with 100 degrees C boiling water, then soaking in room
   temperature water for 24h; 3)soaking in 100 mg.L-1 GA(3) and 6-BA
   solution, respectively for 24h; 4)stratification in varying temperature
   (10-15 degrees C)for 5d, then in low temperature(0-5 degrees C)for 15d.
   The germination rate of T amurensis seed could get to 70.2% by above
   treatment and germination time was shortened to 30 days which was
   greatly improved compared to previous study.

AB Dormancy and germination requirements were investigated in seeds of
   Ferula gummosa Boiss (Apiaceae) and Teucrium polium L. (Labiatae). Seeds
   of both species were subjected to different treatments including various
   levels of GA(3), HNO3, H2SO4, chilling and soaking with water at
   different temperatures. Germination of both species increased at higher
   concentrations of GA3. In the case of F. gummosa highest germination
   percentage was obtained when the seeds were treated, soaked in water at
   5 C. For T. polium seeds, the highest germination percentage was found
   when they were exposed to GA3. The highest germination rate and
   percentage of T. polium seeds were obtained at concentrations of
   500-2500 ppm GA3. Washing and chilling (5 C) for a period of 14 days was
   most effective in breaking dormancy in F. gummosa. Acid scarification by
   H2SO4 (75% v/v), for 5 and 10 min with GA(3) (1500 ppm, 48 h), broke
   dormancy and induced, 31.9% and 34.1 % germination of T. polium,
   respectively. In contrast to F. gummosa which showed no response to
   water soaking, T. polium germination was induced by up to 32.7%. For
   both species, germination rate was positively correlated with
   germination percentage. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB In order to break dormancy and germinate the seeds of Caucasian maple,
   they were collected from altitude of 1900 m of Googli Forest located in
   Savadkooh (north of Iran). Following pre-treatment of warm
   stratification (0, 4, 8, 12 weeks with 20°C), the seeds were soaked for
   24 hours in two separate examinations (1) GA3 (0, 250, 500, 1000 mg/lit)
   and (2) H2O2 (0, 1, 2, 3%) and immediately moved into cold
   stratification environment (4°C, for 41 weeks, with consideration of
   warm stratification period). Both examinations were carried out as
   factorial with three replicates based on completely randomized design.
   Water absorption test revealed that in spite of the hard coat, the seeds
   were permeable to water. Results emphasized the positive effects of warm
   pretreatment on germination characters, whereas seed germination
   increased from 13 to 76% and germination speed from 1.4 to 3.8
   unit/week. However, the lag time decreased from 20 to 13 weeks and
   germination period of 50 percent of seeds (T50) from 10 to 6 weeks.
   Influence of GA3 and H2O2 increased with increase of concentration as
   well as warm stratification period, whereas GA3 in 500 and 1000 mg/lit
   was 64% and H2O2 in 2 and 3% was 56 and 73%, respectively. With
   increasing warm pre-treatment period, the general trend of germination
   speed enhanced in all concentrations of both promoters. Generally,
   stratification (warm-cold) without using the promoters mentioned here is
   easier and more economic for dormancy breaking of Caucasian maple seed.

AB Acer hyrcanum is a rare maple distributed mainly in the Hyrcanian
   Mountain forests of Iran and in other parts of western Asia. Its high
   potential for use in forest rehabilitation programmes is limited due to
   lack of knowledge about its seed germination requirements. In the
   present study, we aimed to investigate the seed dormancy and germination
   requirements of this rare maple. Mature seeds require at least eight
   weeks of cold moist stratification to overcome dormancy and initiate
   seed germination, however, 16 weeks of cold stratification was found to
   be optimum to achieve > 95% germination. GA(3) shortened the cold
   stratification period and enhanced germination but failed to substitute
   for the cold stratification requirement. Pericarp removal did not affect
   overall seed germination but had positive effects on germination indices
   (lag time and T-50). However, it failed to result in normal seedlings.
   Warm stratification and dry storage prior to cold stratification failed
   to show any promising results. The overall results indicated that Balkan
   maple seeds possess a deep physiological dormancy (PD), i.e. C-3a, where
   'C' denotes PD, '3' denotes deep and 'a' denotes exposure to cold
   temperature. Thus, to facilitate production of quality planting stocks
   with high and uniform germination, seeds should be exposed to a long
   period of cold moist stratification to overcome the deep-PD. This could
   be achieved in practice by autumn planting or stratification prior to
   sowing in the spring.

AB Methods for diploid true potato seed (TPS) production and handing are
   crucial for inbred-hybrid potato breeding. This study determined the
   effects of mother plant nutrition on average TPS weight and germination
   kinetics as modeled by Gompertz curves. Additionally, it characterized
   germination of stratified TPS and TPS imbibed in water or gibberellic
   acid (GA(3)). Seeds were produced by three interspecific hybrids between
   diploid relatives of cultivated potato and diploid lines derived from
   cultivated potato. Effects of stratification on seed dormancy and
   germination rate were genotype-dependent. With one exception,
   GA(3)-treated seeds reached 50% germination as fast or faster than
   stratified seeds and seeds imbibed in water. Mother plant nutrition was
   varied by fertilizing with two nutrient solutions that differed in
   composition. Effects of fertilizer type on germination were modest, and
   100-seed weight did not differ between fertilizer types. These findings
   support previous research showing that GA(3) treatment effectively
   promotes robust TPS germination.

AB Acer monospessulanum is one of the important forest species in western
   forests of Iran. Its populations decreased in recent years. Because of
   embryo dormancy and hard seed coat, its seed has both physiological and
   mechanical seed dormancy. The optimal treatment for breaking dormancy
   and seed germination enhancement of this species was investigated. A
   completely randomized design with 3 replicates were used to compare the
   effects of 3 and 6 months chilling (41°C) on the top of paper or in
   sand, 2 concentrations of gibberellic acid (250 and 500 ppm) after
   stratification, scarification with concentrated sulfuric acid for 10 or
   20 min, pretreatment of seeds in alternate temperature (15/25°C,
   night/days) for 3 months in sand before chilling and direct seeding
   (with or without scarification) in pots and maintaining in natural
   conditions on seed germination of Acer monospessulanum L. The results
   showed that sowing seeds in sand significantly (p<0.01) increased
   germination rate and the best treatment was chilling for 6 months (33%).
   Seed germination was not significantly increased by GA3 after chilling.
   Sulfuric acid did not show any effect on seed germination. There was not
   any significant difference between alternate temperatures before
   chilling and chilling for 6 months. Number of germinated seeds in Acer
   increased when seeds were scarified and cultured under the natural
   conditions (35.6% vise 11%). Chilling (6 months) was, therefore, the
   most effective treatment for germination of Montpellier maple seeds.

AB Large-leaved lime (Tilia platyphyllos) is one of the important trees in
   North forests of Iran. Different parts of the tree are being used for
   different purposes. Seeds of the plant do not germinate easily because
   of the existence of double dormancy (mechanical and physiological). This
   study was conducted using factorial experiment based on complete
   randomized design with 3 replicates. Five treatments were applied to the
   seed following surface disinfection using 1% sodium hypochlorite. The
   treatments included: three and six months chilling (41°C) on the top of
   paper or in sand; two concentrations of gibberellic acid (GA, 250 and
   500 ppm) after stratification; scarification with concentrated sulfuric
   acid for 10 or 20 minutes; pretreatment of seeds in alternate
   temperature (15/25°C, night/days) for 3 months in sand before chilling;
   and direct sowing (with or without scarification) in pots and
   maintaining in field conditions. The results showed that sowing seeds in
   sand significantly (P<0.01) increased germination rate and the best
   treatment was chilling for 6 months. Seed germination was showed no
   significant increase by using GA after chilling. Sulfuric acid did not
   show any effect on seed germination. There was no any significant
   difference between alternate temperature before chilling and chilling
   for 6 months. The number of germinated seeds increased from 11 to 32%
   when the seeds were scarified and cultured under field condition.
   Chilling practice of 6 months duration after surface disinfection was
   the most effective treatment for germination of large-leaved lime seeds.

   GA3+21 days of stratification and was followed by 0.8% KNO3 and 100
   mg.l-1 SA along with 21 days of stratification. Mean germination time
   (MGT) decreased with duration of stratification and GA3, SA and KNO3
   application, respectively. The present results indicated that, GA3, SA
   and KNO3 stimulated various growth aspects of Alstroemeria seedlings
   growth in both under in vitro and in vivo, but seeds treated in 100
   mg.l-1 GA3 soulation was more effective. Seeds treated with SA and KNO3
   without stratification and control had no germination. A. ligtu hybrid
   species probably exhibits a combination of physiological dormancy.

AB The phenology of Deginia velebitica seeds, including such topics as
   maturation, dispersal and germination times, is still largely unknown.
   For the purpose of the present research, the seeds were collected in the
   Botanical Garden, Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb and in the
   natural habitat (above Sibinj, Veliki vrh, Velika kapela mountain) at
   the time of natural dispersal. Freshly matured and collected seeds were
   placed under natural conditions (16-28 degrees C), at room temperature
   (24 degrees C), 21 degrees C and in greenhouse conditions (22/31 degrees
   C). Some of the seeds were placed at 5 degrees C for 3, 6, 9, 12 weeks
   and checked to see if cold stratification was needed. The most
   interesting part for the study of germination phenology was the exposure
   of the seeds to temperature conditions similar to those in nature (in
   the garden) and the definition of maximum and minimum temperatures of
   germination. Seed dispersal begins soon after maturation and all seeds
   (100%) are dispersed in one season. After 28 days, low percentages of
   germination, of 8.77% (at 24 degrees C), 6.66% (at 21 degrees C), 14.55%
   (at 22-31 degrees C) and 0% (at 16-28 degrees C) were found, indicating
   non-deep physiological dormancy (PD) in Degenia seeds. Non-deep PD is
   broken by cold stratification and by seeds being stored dry at room
   temperature (afterripening). The highest percentage of germination was
   at 22-31 degrees C, and the lowest at 21 degrees C indicating that
   Degenia velebitica germinates in late summer or early autumn. Seeds do
   not require light for germination, but germination in the light is 54%
   better at 22-3 degrees C, 35% at room temperature and 7% better at 16-28
   degrees C than in the dark. The seeds collected in the Botanical Garden
   germinated 18%, 28% and 30% better at 22-31 degrees C, 16-28 degrees C
   than seeds collected near the place called Bile after 63 days of

AB Seed quality is an important issue in forestry as it is an essential
   parameter in the production of high quality planting material. Many
   factors may hinder the harvesting of high quality seeds, including an
   insufficient number of sunny days, external conditions in temperate
   climate zones, and fungal pathogens affecting development of seedlings.
   We undertook to develop a procedure maximizing seed protection and
   promoting the optimum physiological development of seedlings by
   examination of the impact of seed pelleting (a general seed protection
   method) on germination rates and seedling development of Scots pine
   (Pinus sylvestris L.). Germination of pelleted seeds was examined in
   relation to substrate (water vs. soil) and LED light spectrum (white vs.
   red-blue). Several dormancy breaking treatments were applied:
   stratification/scarification, and growth regulator treatments including
   gibberellic acid (GA(3)), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and
   1-naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA), to stimulate seed germination.
   Experiments included independent tests for each treatment
   (stratification/scarification and plant growth regulators), and
   combinations of both stratification/scarification and phytohormone
   treatments. The impacts of these treatments and various controlled
   germination conditions on the fluorescence of chlorophyll were analyzed
   using the maximum efficiency of photosystem II photochemistry parameter
   (Fv/Fm). In addition, chlorophyll a and b content in Scots pine
   seedlings germinated from pelleted seeds, were quantified using
   high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The combined
   stratification/scarification and growth regulator treatment was the most
   effective germination promoting method for pelleted Scots pine seeds.
   Scots pine seeds are highly likely to be photoblastic. The best
   germination rate, while maintaining optimal physiological parameters,
   was achieved in acidic soil (pH 5.0) with white LED light.

AB Seed vigor in soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) declines under
   environmental stresses, and seed shows signs of aging. The aging effects
   may be alleviated, however, by seed priming with certain chemicals, such
   as salicylic acid (SA). The objective of this study was to investigate
   the effects of SA priming on activities of certain enzymes and lipid
   peroxidation in soybean seedlings under accelerated aging (AA) process.
   A factorial, completely randomized design with three replicates was
   used. Different aging durations (48 h and 72 h), SA priming solutions
   (0, 300 and 600 mu M) and priming times (before aging, after aging and
   both before and after aging, i.e., double priming) were the experimental
   factors. Increasing aging duration significantly increased mean
   emergence time (MET) but decreased carotenoid content. Nonetheless, SA
   solution mitigated the adverse effect of seed deterioration on
   germination-related traits by increasing enzyme activity and reducing
   malondialdehyde (MDA) content, especially under double priming. A strong
   negative correlation (r = - 0.99**) was found between MDA content and
   chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b content. By contrast, the correlation
   between MDA content and MET (r = 0.95**) was found to be positive. The
   results suggested that double SA priming was an appropriate practical
   technique to improve seedling establishment from aged soybean seed.

AB Eryngium maritimum is a coastal plant of the Apiaceae family. This
   species is threatened in several countries where it reaches the northern
   limits of its distribution area. Existing populations in the Baltic
   Region and Scandinavia are potentially affected by the low efficiency of
   its generative reproduction. We studied physiological aspects of its
   germination and dormancy breaking requirements using seeds collected
   from two Latvian populations. Seeds were subjected to cold and warm
   stratification and treatment with gibberellic acid. We monitored the
   development of seed embryos throughout the process of stratification at
   different temperatures and built a size-class structure of embryo
   development within a batch of seeds to visualize the developmental
   progress and to compare different treatments. The final germination
   percentage and germination rate increased after cold stratification at 5
   degrees C in seeds germinated at 25/10 degrees C. Maximum germination
   was achieved after four months of cold stratification. Treatment with
   gibberellic acid had a similar dormancy breaking effect that was
   enhanced by previous warm stratification. The relative size of embryos
   increased during cold stratification, although this increase was not
   uniform. We conclude that in seeds of E. maritimum, embryo growth during
   stratification is required before germination can start and that growth
   is enhanced by warm stratification. Breaking the physiological component
   of seed dormancy requires cold stratification that can be substituted by
   treatment with gibberellic acid. We suggest that germination
   characteristics of seeds and the structure of embryo development within
   seeds in a particular population may reflect the state of the plant
   population itself and provide valuable information for research on the
   biology of this species.

AB Perilla (Perilla frutescens (L.) Britton) mericarps are known to undergo
   dormancy; however, this can be broken by sulfuric acid treatment and
   cold stratification. Cold stratification is thought to be the most
   effective treatment and is customarily performed for 2 weeks to induce
   germination of perilla mericarps. However, this procedure requires an
   additional 2 weeks before sowing and cultivation, thereby decreasing
   cultivation efficiency. To address this problem, germination experiments
   were conducted in this study in order to identify a shorter and more
   efficient pretreatment strategy for germination of perilla mericarps.
   Pretreatment with sulfuric acid (10 min versus 1 min) and gibberellin (8
   h and 1 h versus 5 min, at a rate of 100 versus 10 ppm) were performed
   using mericarps from pure strains of perilla. As a result, sulfuric acid
   treatment tended to reduce the germination rate, while gibberellin
   treatment resulted in an equivalent or similar germination rate as cold
   stratification. Gibberellin treatment was also found to be effective in
   mericarps with a relatively old harvest date and low germination energy.
   Considering the convenience and safety of the treatment process as well
   as the results of the germination experiments, these findings suggest
   that a short period of gibberellin treatment could help shorten the
   process of perilla cultivation.

AB Prostrate euphorbia (Euphorbia maculata L.) is an important weed in
   soybean and cotton fields of Golestan province. In this research, the
   effect of pre-chilling, gibberellic acid and temperature on germination
   percentage and rate of E. maculata seeds was investigated in 2008.
   Pre-chilling significantly increased germination percentage but had no
   significant effect on germination rate. Seed germination enhanced as the
   gibberellic acid concentration increased from 500 to 2000 ppm, but there
   was no significant difference between 1000 and 2000 ppm. Gibberellic
   acid, compared with control, had no significant effect on seed
   germination rate. Seed germination was started at 15°C and increased as
   the temperature raised up to 30°C. Percentage and rate of germination
   were constant between 30 & 35°C and 25 & 30°C, respectively, but there
   were huge reductions in these indices at 40°C, similar to 5 & 15°C Based
   on these results, pre-chilling, gibberellic acid at 2000 ppm and
   incubation at 30°C were the optimum conditions for seed germination of
   E. maculata.

   gathered from natural habitat located in the Koohdasht city (Lorestan
   province) and transferred to Kermanshah Agricultural and Natural
   Resources Research and Education Center in the summer of 2014. For each
   species separate experiments in a completely randomized design with 14
   treatments and 4 replications was done. Treatments included
   moist-chilling time (control, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 70 and 90 days at
   4°C), gibberellic acid concentration (200, 400, 600 and 800 PPM) and
   integrated treatment of gibberellic acid 400 ppm with moist-chilling for
   30 days and 70 days. The results showed that for both species increasing
   of moist-chilling duration and concentration of gibberellic acid
   significantly increased germination percentage, germination rate and
   seed vigor index. The best breaking seed dormancy treatment was
   moist-chilling of 90 days for seeds of (Citruluus colocynthis) and
   gibberellic acid 800 ppm for (Silybum mrianum). The result showed that
   seeds of two species had the combination of physiological (related to

AB Miscanthus x giganteus has been widely cultivated in Europe and North
   America and is considered a potential biofuel plant. However, a barrier
   is the lacking establishment of inexpensive and successful stands. As a
   progenitor of M. x giganteus, M. sinensis could be potentially
   propagated by seed, with comparable biomass yield in some areas. The
   germination of seed plays an important role in establishing M. sinensis
   in the field. However, dormancy may not be advantageous for a seed to
   germinate freely. It is widely recognized that temperature is a key
   factor for seed dormancy and germination. In this study, two different
   temperature methods were hypothesized for promoting the seed germination
   of M. sinensis. The results showed that both 4 degrees C and 10 degrees
   C moist pre-chill treatment for 21days had a positive effect on breaking
   dormancy. Nevertheless, 10 degrees C treatment showed the ability to
   promote germinated seed growth, especially in the radical, which
   provided a rapid growth for establishment. For dry pre-heat treatments,
   30 degrees C for 30days was the suitable treatment for increasing
   overall germination, as well as growth vigor. Furthermore, for saving
   time and labor, 50 degrees C for 10days also could be a choice as
   pre-treatment before sowing. In addition, there is a possibility that
   the high temperature sometimes reinforced dormancy or even induced seed
   death, but could well increase the radical growth, indicating that high
   temperature could be an unfavorable environment signal to cause the seed
   self-protection mechanism to dormancy. Therefore, high temperature level
   and duration of treatment for pre-heat seeds is necessary for further
   field performance studies.

   Capsicum frutescens and cultivated C. annum. Seeds were exposed to 8
   levels of water potential (Psi) induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG)
   8000. Seed germination is usually affected by water stress. Seeds were
   exposed to 8 levels of Psi induced by PEG-8000. C. annuum showed final
   germination percentage of 73%. However, no significant differences were
   observed among Psi treatments between species. Mean germination rate was
   lower for C. frutescens than for C. annuum. Variation in epicotyl and
   hypocotyl growth was observed between treatments, but no clear pattern
   was observed across Psi treatments. Root:shoot ratio index was higher
   for C. annuum than for C. frutescens. Root:shoot ratio index differences
   were significant among Psi treatments in the case of C. annuum, while
   for C. frutescens differences were not significant. Root:shoot ratio
   index was a reliable drought tolerance indicator for both pepper
   species. An increase in root:shoot ratio as a function of water stress
   levels suggest a priming effect on C. annuum improving seedling growth
   under water stress. In the case of C. frutescens, no decrease effect on
   root:shoot ratio index was evident suggesting an adaptive characteristic
   to growth under arid and semi-arid climatic conditions in Baja
   California Sur, USA.

AB Bunium persicum is an important medical plant with dormant seed and it
   is established and distributed only in its natural habitats. In order to
   determine the effects of some pretreatment factors on primary growth and
   germination characteristics of two Bunium persicum, an experiment was
   conducted as split-factorial layout within completely randomized design
   at Seed Research Laboratory, Islamic Azad University, Khorasgan
   (Esfahan) Branch in 2011. Most pre-chilling treatments were 0, 15, 30
   and 45 days and cultivars were consisted of Esfahan and Mashad. Hormone
   treatments were GA(3), BA, KI, GA(3)+BA, GA(3)+KI, BA+KI, GA(3)+BA+KI,
   KNO3, H2SO4 and distilled water as a control treatment. Pre-chilling had
   significant effect on coleoptile length, radicle length, seedling
   length, germination percentage, mean time for germination, germination
   rate and seed vigour index. Cultivar also had significant influence on
   coleoptile length, radicle length, seedling length, germination
   percentage, germination rate and seed vigour index. All experimental
   characteristics except uniformity of seed germination were affected by
   hormone treatments. The maximum coleoptile length, radicle length,
   seedling length, germination percentage, germination ratio and seedling
   vigour index were related to 45 days moist pre-chilling treatment.
   Esfahan also obtained the highest coleoptile and radicle length,
   seedling length, germination percentage, germination ratio and seedling
   vigour index. It seems that application of endogenous GA(3)+KI and BA+KI
   concentration, which is provided mostly by chilling treatment, is the
   most effective factor for breaking the seed dormancy. On the basis of
   the results, usage of 45 days moist pre-chilling accompanied by
   application of GA(3)+KI and BA+KI in Esfahan cultivar was appropriate.

AB The bilberry (Vaccinitiln myrtillus L.) is a spontaneous dwarf shrub
   with potential for national and international markets due to food and
   medicinal uses of its fruits, being considered an important source of
   sugars, antioxidants, vitamins and minerals. Request for bilberry fruits
   are on the rise, but the land area covered in bilberry bushes and
   locally collected berries have declined in Central Italian Apennine
   regions in recent last decades. The objective of this study was to
   assess the most suitable conditions for in vivo and in vitro seed
   germination in order to improve the reproductive performance of this
   species under artificial and controlled environments. Freshly matured
   bilberry seeds were tested for germination before and after cold
   stratification and air-room storage under different light conditions and
   temperatures. Seeds were then in vivo and in vitro germinated on
   different soil types and culture media. Fresh seeds showed a better
   germination capacity (76%) than stratified ones, being 16-h photoperiod
   and air temperatures of 22.5 degrees C the optimal conditions for
   germination. At 25 degrees C the germination rate decreased to 66% and
   very few seeds (8%) germinated at 15 degrees C. Darkness always had a
   negative influence on the germination capacity. However, after cold
   stratification germination increased significantly at 15 degrees C, both
   in light (51%) and darkness (24%); thus, seeds of this species are
   conditionally dormant at maturity. Although the effect was different
   depending on temperature and light condition, cold seed stratification
   had an overall negative effect on all the considered germination
   parameters, and seed viability was strongly reduced after storage at
   room temperature for 90 days. Soil type and culture media did not
   significantly affect the final germination percentage (approximate to 62
   and 78%) in the in vivo and in vitro trials performed on fresh non
   stratified seeds, respectively. Nevertheless V. myrtillus turf (in vivo
   experiment) and modified MS medium (in vitro experiment) gave rise to
   the most germination in the shortest time. Temperature proved to be the
   most influential physical factor on bilberry seed germination. Seedlings
   obtained from in vivo experiments showed good development.

   corn varieties and profiled their chilling resistance level. Besides, to
   determine the effect of salicylic acid (SA) treatment on plants under
   cold stress, we treated the corn with SA and then selected
   chilling-resistant and chilling-sensitive varieties. Our data
   demonstrated that the germination energy (GE), germination percentage
   (GP), and germination index (GI) for most of the cold treated corn
   varieties were lower than those of the control group. The membership
   function (MF) and D-value results showed that HengYu709 was a chilling
   resistant corn variety while DongDan213 was sensitive to the chilling
   stimuli. Furthermore, treatment with SA enhanced the chilling resistance
   in both HengYu709 and DongDan213. In addition, the data showed that 0.5
   or 1.0 mmol/l SA treatment significantly increased photosynthesis and
   oxidase activity in corn under cold stress. However, a high
   concentration of SA could reduce the photosynthesis indexes. Taken
   together, our data demonstrate that SA treatment could alleviate the
   effect of cold stress in corn growth and development.

   subjected to a temperature of 35 degrees C did germinate with a maximum

AB In western Canada, common bean is often sown in cool soils, which causes
   poor germination and uneven stand establishment. A major goal in bean
   breeding is to find and assess cold-tolerant parental material. Seed
   germination and emergence of 12 diverse common bean genotypes, which
   included adapted Prairie cultivars, were evaluated in petri dishes under
   15 alternating and five constant temperature regimes. Cumulative heat
   hours to maximum germination were calculated for all 12 genotypes using
   abase temperature of 9 degrees C. Six genotypes were tested for
   emergence in soil in growth chambers at two temperature and three soil
   moisture regimes. In petri tests, optimal temperatures for bean
   germination were 16/16 degrees C (day/night temperature) or higher.
   68823, 69345 and AC Polaris germinated below 10 degrees C, and all
   genotypes germinated at 12 degrees C or higher. Rapid germinating
   genotypes with > 0.09 cumulative heat hours per percentage germination
   were 68823, 69345 and AC Polaris, which took the least number of
   cumulative heat hours to germinate (< 1100 heat hours). CDC Pinnacle was
   the highest representative of the medium germination rate group, having
   1170 heat hours to germination. Emergence and plant development in soil
   were decreased by low moisture availability or cooler temperatures.
   Genotypes with > 80% emergence in soil were CDC Crocus, CDC Nighthawk;
   CDC Pinnacle and CDC Polar Bear. Differing genotype rankings in soil
   versus petri dishes demonstrated that germination. in controlled cool
   conditions may still be complicated by dormancy, moisture availability,
   seed coat thickness, imbibition rate and differing viabilities of seed
   lots. 68823, 69345 and AC Polaris are promising genotypes for developing
   cultivars that can germinate under cool temperatures (< 10 degrees C) at
   the highest rate..

AB The rat's tail radish, Pakki-hood, is cultivated in northern Thailand.
   It produces inflorescences and a large number of young siliquas (pods)
   which are used as a vegetable. The response of Pakki-hood to low
   temperature was examined to determine its suitability for winter sowing
   in Japan. Seeds of Pakki-hood and 5 Japanese radish cultivars were
   germinated in the dark at 5, 10, 15 or 20°C. The germination rate (sum
   of the number of germinated seeds/number of days to germinate) decreased
   with decreasing temperature. A significant difference was found between
   the germination rate of Pakki-hood and Japanese cultivars at 5° (13.9
   and 0.9-2.5, respectively). The critical temperature for the growth of
   Pakki-hood seedlings ranged from 5 to 10°. The hypocotyls of Pakki-hood
   and cv. Shogoin grew spindly at temperatures above 15 and 20°,
   respectively. When Pakki-hood seedlings grown at a high temperature
   (25/20°) for 5 days were chilled at 0° in the dark for 3 or more days
   and then returned to the 25/20°-regime, hypocotyl growth was markedly
   inhibited; seedlings showed distinct symptoms of chilling injury after 3
   days of chilling treatment. Electrolyte leakage from hypocotyls
   increased markedly after chilling; the hypocotyl cells were disrupted by
   chilling for more than 2 days. The photosynthetic rate of leaf discs
   taken from 30-day-old seedlings of Pakki-hood and 7 Japanese radish
   cultivars, grown at 25/20°, was assessed at 30° and 5°. The rate of
   inhibition of photosynthesis at low temperatures was much lower for
   Pakki-hood than for the Japanese radish cultivars. It is concluded that
   Pakki-hood could be winter sown for spring harvest in Japan.

AB Spreading orach is an annual weed that colonizes roadsides, field edges,
   and increasingly, no-till agricultural fields. It produces dimorphic
   seeds with different levels of physiological dormancy, but little is
   known about the germination ecology of the two seed types. Field and
   controlled-environment studies were conducted to determine seed
   responses to light and stratification, the pattern of seedling emergence
   in the field, and the effect of soil water content on the length of cold
   stratification required to break dormancy for each seed type. The large,
   brown seeds have three times the mass of the smaller, black seeds,
   primarily because of a larger embryo, but have a thinner seed coat.
   Germination of brown and black seeds in petri dishes was 98 and 90%,
   respectively, after stratification for 3 mo at 5 C, whereas germination
   of unstratified seeds was 19 and 12%, respectively. Light stimulated
   germination of both stratified and unstratified black seeds but did not
   increase germination in stratified brown seeds. Up to 40% of brown seeds
   germinated in situ during stratification, compared with only 2% for
   black seeds. Germination in petri dishes and emergence in the field were
   more rapid for brown seeds than for black seeds. Maximum germination of
   black seeds occurred after stratification for 2 or 3 mo at 5 C on soil
   that was waterlogged (pore-water matric potential, psi = 0 kPa), wet
   (psi = -0-38 kPa), or at field capacity (psi = -10 kPa). For shorter
   periods of stratification, total germination and germination rate of
   black seeds declined as soil water content decreased from waterlogged to
   dry (psi = -500 kPa). Seed dimorphism in spreading orach may provide a
   mechanism to enhance survival in uncertain or variable habitats such as
   disturbed agricultural fields.

AB Backgrounds and aims In tropical recalcitrant seeds, their rapid
   transition from shedding to germination at high hydration level is of
   physiological interest but difficult to study because of the time
   constraint. In recalcitrant horse chestnut seeds produced in central
   Russia, this transition is much longer and extends through dormancy and
   dormancy release. This extended time period permits studies of the water
   relations in embryonic axes during the long recalcitrant period in terms
   of vacuolar status and water transport.
   Methodology Horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum) seeds sampled in
   Moscow were stratified in cold wet sand for 4 months. Vacuole presence
   and development in embryonic axes were examined by vital staining, light
   and electron microscopy. Aquaporins and vacuolar H+-ATPase were
   identified immunochemically. Water channel operation was tested by water
   inflow rate. Vacuolar acid invertase was estimated in terms of activity
   and electrophoretic properties.
   Principal results Throughout the long recalcitrant period after seed
   shedding, cells of embryonic axes maintained active vacuoles and a high
   water content. Preservation of enzyme machinery in vacuoles was evident
   from retention of invertase activity, substrate specificity, molecular
   mass and subunit composition. Plasmalemma and tonoplast aquaporins and
   the E subunit of vacuolar H+-ATPase were also present. In non-dormant
   seeds prior to growth initiation, vacuoles enlarged at first in
   hypocotyls, and then in radicles, with their biogenesis being similar.
   Vacuolation was accompanied by increasing invertase activity, leading to
   sugar accumulation and active osmotic functioning. After growth
   initiation, vacuole enlargement was favoured by enhanced water inflow
   through water channels formed by aquaporins.
   Conclusions Maintenance of high water content and desiccation
   sensitivity, as well as preservation of active vacuoles in embryonic
   axes after shedding, can be considered a specific feature of
   recalcitrant seeds, overlooked when studying tropical recalcitrants due
   to the short duration. The retained physiological activity of vacuoles
   allows them to function rapidly as dormancy is lost and when external
   conditions permit. Cell vacuolation precedes cell elongation in both
   hypocotyl and radicle, and provides impetus for rapid germination.

   separated into two seed lots on colour basis. The seeds were germinated
   after treatment with KNO3 or GA(3), or pre-chilling. After treatment
   with GA, amylase activity in the seeds was quantified. The dark brown
   seed lot (KD) was composed of heavier seeds than the light brown seed
   lot (KL), which showed high germination. GA3 improved the rate and total
   germination percentage in wild mustard. The high concentration of GA(3)
   (0.1 %) released dormancy in the dark seed lot KD and yielded high

AB The aim of this study was to assess the length of the after-ripening
   period and the germination capacity of fresh and dried seeds of six
   Caucasian pear (Pyrus communis var. caucasica Fed.) genotypes: GK1, GK2,
   GK3, 'Elia', 'Belia' and 'Doria'. Additionally, important traits of
   rootstocks obtained from 'Elia', 'Belia' and 'Doria' seeds were
   compared. Two methods of after-ripening of seeds were applied:
   stratification of individual fresh or dry seeds in trays filled with
   moist sphagnum peat and conventional stratification of dry seeds. At the
   beginning of April, after stratification treatments, trays were
   transferred to an unheated plastic tunnel or to a heated glasshouse.
   Finally, young seedlings obtained in the unheated plastic tunnel, were
   planted in the same field where seedlings raised from conventionally
   stratified and sown directly in the field seeds, were grown. The studied
   genotypes differed in length of dormancy, germination rate and final
   output of seedlings obtained. Seeds from the late-ripening genotypes had
   a shorter dormancy period than seeds obtained from the early ripening
   types. Height and diameter of rootstocks did not significantly differ
   between treatments. However, rootstocks raised in trays had a better
   root system than those raised by sowing directly in the field.

AB In order to reveal some of the germination requirements of the
   boreal-alpine terrestrial orchid Dactylorhiza lapponica, several
   experiments were carried out on seeds collected from the Solendet nature
   reserve, central Norway. Seeds were sown in seed packets made of nylon
   cloth and deployed in situ vertically in the peat in order to study the
   temporal pattern of seed germination and determine if the seeds became
   part of the soil seed bank. In vitro germination experiments were
   carried out varying the growth media, fungal partner and chilling
   treatment, in order to study the effect of a fungal symbiont on
   germination and early protocorm development, and the possibility of a
   physiological seed dormancy. A high rate of germination a short time
   after sowing in the in vitro experiments together with a very low
   survival after deployment in the in situ experiments (0.2% after three
   years) indicate that D. lapponica seeds are not part of a long-lived
   soil seed bank. In vitro experiments also demonstrated that a fungal
   symbiont was not required for germination. Seeds sown in situ had very
   low germination rate (11%-12%) and lack of available nutrients is
   suggested as a possible explanation. Presence of a fungal symbiont
   clearly enhanced the early development of protocorms in vitro, and is
   probably necessary for the seedling to grow beyond the earliest
   protocorm stages under natural conditions. The results indicate that
   recruitment is highly variable and very low relative to population size,
   indicating that survival of established plants is crucial to the fate of
   a population.

   to investigate the effects of cold stratification for different periods
   (90, 120 and 150 days) and different pH values (pH 6.5, 7.5 and 8.5) on

AB Corema album, is a dioecious specie endemic to the Atlantic coast of the
   Iberian Peninsula, with potential to be part of the small fruit market.
   In this perspective, it was intended to evaluate the propagation
   capacity of this species, vegetative (cuttings) and seminal, given the
   interest of its establishment in culture. For the vegetative
   propagation, the influence of the origin of the genotypes (9 origins),
   the substrate (2 substrates) and the characteristics of the plant
   material to propagate in the survival and rooting capacity of the
   cuttings were evaluated. The place of origin had a significant influence
   on rooting with Lagoa de Sto. Andre presented the highest total rooting
   percentage (54.2%) and Vila Real de Santo Antonio obtained the best
   results regarding the abundance of root system formed. The rooting
   results on the Siro substrate were significantly better (57.8%) than in
   the Fataca (20.3%). Stem tips actively growing (green - not lignified)
   had the best results. Regarding seminal propagation, the effect of
   different stratification cycles on 4 genotypes from the same site,
   Aldeia do Meco, was tested. The seeds were subjected to different
   repetitions of the following cycle: 40°C (dried seeds), 4°C (hydrated
   seeds) and 15/25°C (hydrated seeds) in a growth chamber (photoperiod 16
   hours light). Each cycle had the duration of 4 weeks per phase. The
   highest germination rates in all genotypes (49%) were obtained with two
   high/low temperature cycles. The germination rate was statistically
   different between the genotypes. The results demonstrated that the
   success obtained in both forms of propagation is promising with respect
   to the multiplication of the species, thus allowing the establishment of
   a clone elected as a producer of fruit and tools for the development of
   a breeding program.

   Different parts of caper such as roots, fruits, flowers and buds can be

   to determine germination rate and percentage of caper according to
   different duration of cold stratification (10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60
   days) treatments. Cold stratification procedures under greenhouse
   condition were applied for eliminating seed dormancy to find the most
   suitable germination conditions because the presence of seed dormancy
   causes difficulties in seedling production. The seed germination started
   and stopped 21 and 57 days after sowing, respetively. While the highest
   germination percentage (46.6%) was obtained in seeds that were cold
   stratified for 60 days, the lowest germination percentage (3.67%) was

AB Purpletop [Tridens flavus (L.) Hitchc.] and big bluestem (Andropogon
   gerardii Vitman) are incorporated into native grass seed mixes for use
   in ecological restoration. Alleviation of low seed vigor and poor stand
   establishment would benefit the restoration process by increasing the
   animal habitat in restored zones. This study determined the
   effectiveness of prechilling with distilled water (dH2O) versus
   potassium nitrate (KNO3), sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) treatments, and
   short-term storage conditions on seed germination, seedling growth, and
   stand establishment of purpletop and big bluestem. Prechilling of
   'Niagara, NY Ecotype' big bluestem for 7 days at 5°C in dH2O increased
   final germination percentage (FGP) and germination rate provided
   caryopses were not dried before sowing. Optimal FGP, germination rate,
   and germination synchrony were obtained for 'VA Ecotype' purpletop after
   prechilling for 14 days at 5°C in dH2O without subsequent caryopsis
   drying or at 0.2% KNO3 with or without subsequent caryopsis drying.
   Prechilling increased germination synchrony for purpletop but not for
   big bluestem. NaOCl treatments did not enhance germination or seedling
   vigor of purpletop or big bluestem. Using nonstored, prechilled
   caryopses resulted in greater root lengths than stored caryopses or
   nontreated controls, although optimal purpletop growth required that
   they be sowed moist, whereas optimal big bluestem growth required that
   they be dried-back before sowing. In greenhouse experiments, higher
   seeding rates were correlated with increased number of seedlings for
   nontreated or prechilled big bluestem and for prechilled purpletop, but
   not for nontreated purpletop, which had poor stand establishment at all
   seeding rates. The results indicate that prechilling of caryopses before
   incorporation into a warm-season grass seed mix increased seedling
   establishment of purpletop but not big bluestem.

AB Common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) is an allergenic invasive
   weed rapidly expanding its distribution range throughout Europe. Seed
   dormancy is among the most important seed adaptation traits, helping
   colonizing plants to avoid adverse environmental conditions.
   Furthermore, knowledge of seed dormancy enables to predict the seed
   germination timing of species and enforce specific management practices
   at suitable times. This study was aimed at determining the seed dormancy
   differences among different common ragweed populations distributed in
   two distinct regions of Turkey (i.e., eastern and western parts of the
   country). The seeds of all populations were extremely dormant
   (80.50-96.71% dormancy). The populations distributed in western part of
   the country were more dormant than eastern populations. Mechanical
   scarification and cold-wet stratification at 4°C for 2, 3 and 4 weeks
   were tested to infer their potential in releasing seed dormancy.
   Cold-wet stratification proved effective in releasing seed dormancy;
   however, populations differed in the stratification time required for
   seed dormancy release. Overall, eastern populations became non-dormant
   with lesser stratification time (i.e., 2 weeks), while western
   populations took longer stratification time to become completely
   non-dormant. Mechanical scarification with sandpaper also released seed
   dormancy and all populations behaved similar for this technique. This
   knowledge can be used to predict the germination timing of different
   populations distributed in two distinct regions of the country.
   Furthermore, the results can also be utilized in implementing effective
   management strategies at the proper time.

AB Cardinal temperatures and thermal time are useful tools to quantify the
   impact of climate change on plant developmental processes such as seed
   germination. In this study, we quantified the thermal germination
   behaviour of two cactus species and predicted the effect of increased
   soil temperature (under a shrub canopy and in unshaded areas) on
   germination timing under projected climate change scenarios. To achieve
   these aims, seeds of both species were germinated across a range of
   temperatures from 5 to 40 degrees C, and a probit cardinal temperature
   model was employed to obtain the thermal coefficients. Projected
   temperature increase by 2090-2099 according to IPCC scenarios BI, Al B
   and A2 were estimated and environmental and soil heat sum were
   calculated. We conclude that an increase in soil temperature is.
   predicted to alter the timing of germination but this will not be
   detrimental to the proportion of seeds which germinate. Thus mitigation
   of extreme temperatures, such as achieved under a shrub canopy, is not a
   crucial factor for germination success in these Polaskia species during
   the 21st century. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The importance of thermal thresholds for predicting seed dormancy
   release and germination timing under the present climate conditions and
   simulated climate change scenarios was investigated. In particular,
   Vitis vinifera subsp. sylvestris was investigated in four Sardinian
   populations over the full altitudinal range of the species (from approx.
   100 to 800 m a.s.l).
   Dried and fresh seeds from each population were incubated in the light
   at a range of temperatures (1025 and 25/10 C), without any pre-treatment
   and after a warm (3 months at 25 C) or a cold (3 months at 5 C)
   stratification. A thermal time approach was then applied to the
   germination results for dried seeds and the seed responses were modelled
   according to the present climate conditions and two simulated scenarios
   of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): B1 (18 C) and
   A2 (34 C).
   Cold stratification released physiological dormancy, while very few
   seeds germinated without treatments or after warm stratification. Fresh,
   cold-stratified seeds germinated significantly better (80 ) at
   temperatures epsilon 20 C than at lower temperatures. A base temperature
   for germination (T-b) of 90113 C and a thermal time requirement for 50
   of germination (THETA(50)) ranging from 336 Cd to 686 Cd were identified
   for non-dormant cold-stratified seeds, depending on the populations.
   This complex combination of thermal requirements for dormancy release
   and germination allowed prediction of field emergence from March to May
   under the present climatic conditions for the investigated populations.
   The thermal thresholds for seed germination identified in this study
   (T-b and THETA(50)) explained the differences in seed germination
   detected among populations. Under the two simulated IPCC scenarios, an
   altitude-related risk from climate warming is identified, with lowland
   populations being more threatened due to a compromised seed dormancy
   release and a narrowed seed germination window.

AB Objective: To study the effect of stratification and gibberellin (GA3)
   joint treatment on the germination of Mosla chinensis Maxim. seeds, so
   as to provide basis for the artificial cultivation of Mosla chinensis
   Maxim. in large scale. Method: Treated at 5-10, 15, 20°C and laminated
   with river sand, sawdust and filter paper respectively, then the seeds
   of Mosla chinensis Maxim. were soaked in 400, 600, 800 mg/L GA3 solution
   for 18, 24, 30 h respectively and then subjected to germination test in
   25°C germinator. Result: The optimal germination conditions were
   determined to be germination temperature of 25°C, stratification treated
   under 5-10°C, GA3 concentration of 800 mg/L, soaking duration of 30 h.
   Under the above conditions, the germination rate of Mosla chinensis
   Maxim. seeds reached as high as 96.25%. Conclusion: The germination rate
   of Mosla chinensis Maxim, seeds can be promoted significantly by
   stratification and GA3 joint treatment, which would lay foundation for
   the artificial cultivation of Mosla chinensis Maxim. in large scale.

AB The effects of seed age and storage on seed germination, and of
   fertilizer application on seedling development were studied in
   lingonberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea) and low-bush blueberry (V.
   angustifolium). Lingonberry seed treatments consisted of: fruit storage
   in plastic bags at 2-3°C for five months or at ambient temperature
   (18-20°C) before sowing; seed storage at ambient temperature for one
   year before sowing; fruit stratification for five months before sowing;
   and fruit stratification, seed storage at ambient temperature for two
   years, and seed stratification for five months before sowing. For
   low-brush blueberry, seeds collected in autumn were stratified for five
   months or stored in paper bags at ambient temperature before sowing, or
   seeds collected during the previous year were stored at ambient
   temperature and stratified for five months, or were just stored at
   ambient temperature before sowing. The highest germination percentage in
   lingonberry was recorded for seeds that were immediately stratified
   (74%). Stratification did not significantly improve the germination of
   two-year-old seeds, indicating that lingonberry seeds easily lose their
   germinative capacity. In low-bush blueberry, seeds that were stratified
   for five months before sowing gave the highest seed germination rate
   (84%). The most vigorous seedlings were irrigated twice (12 and 26 June)
   or thrice (12 June, 26 June, and 10 July) with the fertilizer solution
   Peat PG-Mix or Expert Gardener at 1 g/litre (3 litres per transplant
   box). The highest percentage of seedlings suitable for cultivation in
   the field (more than 90%) was obtained with the application of Expert
   Gardener twice or thrice, and with Peat G-Mix thrice.

AB For the experiment, lingonberry variety 'Erntesegen' was used. The
   experiment included four variants: (1) fresh berries were stratified at
   3 degreesC for 5 months; (2) fresh berries were stored at a temperature
   of 18-20 degreesC until sowing; (3) seeds were kept at a temperature of
   18-20 degreesC for one year and stratified for 4 months at a temperature
   of 3 degreesC before sowing; (4) as in variant 3, but seeds were stored
   for 2 years before stratifying. For all variants, seeds were sown at the
   beginning of February in an unfertilised oligotrophic peat substrate (pH
   4.0) in 6 replicates, each including 25 seeds. Three replicates of each
   variant were treated with Trichoderma viride strain (Mode A), and three
   replicates were left in a natural state (Mode B). Germination rate was
   registered on every 5(th) day. Germination of seeds began 17 days after
   sowing in variant 1. In the other three variants, seed germination began
   a week later, on the 21(st) day. Germination rate during the first weeks
   was slowest in variant 4. The best germination rate - 73.2% (Mode A) and
   72.0% (Mode B) - was observed in seeds of the 1st variant of the
   experiment. Seeds of the 4th variant germinated very slowly and their
   germination rate was the lowest, 17.2% (Mode A) and 13.2% (Mode B).
   Stratification seems to raise their germination ability to about 25%.
   Two years old stratified seeds without the Tricoderma treatment had the
   same germination rate as fresh seeds without stratification but with
   Trichoderma in the substrate. Stratification enhances the germination
   rate of two-year-old seeds of lingonberry. Lingonberry seeds lose their
   germination ability rather quickly. Statistical analysis of data by
   means of Generalised Linear Model procedure confirmed the significant
   difference between experimental variants (p = 0.001), while the
   differences between modus appeared to be statistically unreliable (p =
   0.90).

AB An analysis was performed on chilli pepper (Capsicum annuum) cultivars
   Huay Si Thon and Shishito seed vigour and quality produced by plants
   grown under control and high temperature conditions (292/242 and
   362/272°C, mean day and night temperatures, respectively) after anthesis
   to elucidate the effect of high temperature during seed development on
   seed quality. High temperature significantly reduced fruit growth in
   both cultivars. More than 20% of the seeds produced under the high
   temperature regime were flat with a dark brown colour and did not
   germinate. High temperature inhibited seed fresh and dry weight increase
   and the seed size was slightly reduced. Standard germination of Huay Si
   Thon and Shishito seeds occurring under high temperature conditions was
   lower than that of the control seeds by 28 and 25%, respectively.
   Similarly, seed vigour was reduced, as evidenced by the reduction in the
   accelerated aging germination rate and the higher value of the
   germination index. Protein content was maximum during the early stages
   of seed development and decreased afterwards continuously during the
   seed maturation stage, while no conspicuous reduction of the protein
   content by heat was observed. High temperature reduced the carbohydrate
   content of seeds by 40% in Huay Si Ton and 50% in Shishito. High
   temperature reduced the lipid content to less than half.

AB Germination characteristics,dormancy causes,dormancy types and methods
   of breaking dormancy of Gynostemma pentaphyllum seeds which were
   collected from Jinxiu county in Guangxi,were investigated in this
   paper,so as to provide scientific basis for the seed propagation of G.
   pentaphyllum. The results indicated that: (1)The viability of G.
   pentaphyllum freshly mature seeds was 91%, but when incubated at 10
   degrees C similar to 35 degrees C constant temperature and 15 degrees
   C/25 degrees C alternating temperature,germination percentages of them
   were less than 10%. The viability of freshly seed was significantly
   greater than the germination percentage, which indicated that there was
   obvious dormancy phenomenon in freshly collected G. pentaphyllum seeds.
   (2)G. pentaphyllum seed coat is water permeable. the embryo fully
   developed, the germination percentage of in vitro embryos was (78.0 +/-
   4. 8)%,and in vitro embryos could produce normal seedlings,which
   indicated that in vitro embryos of G. pentaphyllum seeds were
   non-dormant. (3) Water extract of whole seeds and crushed seeds. had
   inhibitory activity on seed germination rate, height of seedling and
   root length of seedling of cabbage. The inhibitory effect enhanced
   significantly with the increase of water extract concentration, and the
   inhibitory effect of crushed seeds was greater than that of whole seeds;
   When water extract of crushed seeds at a concentration of 5%, seed
   germination rate,height of seedling and root length of seedling of
   cabbage were only 18. 0%1,0. 1 cm and 0. 1 cm respectively,77. 1%,97. 3%
   and 95.8% lower than that of control. These indicated that there were
   water-soluble germination inhibitory substances in seed coat and
   endosperm of G. pentaphyllum,which was one of the main causes of seed
   dormancy. (4)GA(3) and 6-BA could not improve the germination of G.
   pentaphyllum seeds, but cold stratification could promote seed dormancy
   release. These results indicate that G. pentaphyllum seeds possess
   non-deep physiological dormancy. (5) Low-temperature dry storage was the
   best way for seed conservation of G. pentaphyllum, which could also
   break seed dormancy.

   500 and 1000 mg/litre); several physiological indices e.g., the weight
   per 1000-seed, moisture content, the rate of water absorption and seed
   vigour were measured. Results showed that the average 1000-seed weight
   and water content of the seeds were 4.50480.0558g and 13.181.84%,
   respectively, with the rate of water absorption at 29.951.58% and the
   seed vigour at 94.250.0171%, while the seed germination rate was 0.
   Stratification time had no significant effect on the germination
   percentage (GP). In the treatment of soaking seeds for 20min under 50%
   sulfuric acid, the highest GP was 18.003.46%. The treatment of seeds
   soaked for 24h under 250, 500, 1000 mg gibberellic acid/kg followed by
   stratification for 75d, their GPs were 72.677.02, 68.003.46, 64.005.29%,
   respectively, significantly higher than the control (1.671.15%). It
   suggested that presoaking the seeds with gibberellic acid was one of the
   best ways to break dormancy.

   germination of endemic species Betonica bulgarica Deg. et Neic, as well
   as 1000 seeds weight of four natural habitats from the Nature Park
   Sinite Kamani, Bulgaria. Harvested seeds from plants in the Sinite
   Kamani Nature Park were collected by means of insulators to assist the
   natural reproduction of the populations. The seed germination was
   studied in petri dishes after different temperature treatments - in a
   laboratory at 15°C, in a thermostat at 20°C and 25°C, at a temperature
   of 5°C, treated with water at 35°C, and direct sowing in the soil
   without any treatment. It was found that B. bulgarica is characterized
   by a prolonged period of germination and emergence. The best results
   were achieved after direct sowing in soil - 35.0%, followed by seeds
   placed for germination in laboratory conditions at 15°C - 25.0%.
   Treatments of stratification and hot water at 35°C did not give good
   results for seed germination. The 1000-seed weight of four populations
   was an average of 0.971 g, from 0.840 to 1.055 g.

AB In order to study the germination capacity of Cryptogramma crispa,
   spores were cultured on sterilized Petri dishes with nutritive medium
   solidified with agar. Germination was checked at 10, 15, 20 and 25
   degrees C, and, as in most of homosporous ferns, the germination optimum
   was at temperatures above 20 degrees C. Two light intensities were used,
   10 and 40 mu Em (2)s (1), to reproduce the possibilities of the spores
   Falling on open sites or in rock cracks or hollows. A lower light
   intensity accelerates germination. After sowing, some plates were kept
   at chilling and other at freezing temperatures to check the effect of
   low storage temperatures on the germination capacity of the spores.
   After these processes, the spores are able to germinate and reach
   similar germination rates, although the frozen spores delay the
   beginning of germination and show a decreased germination rate. The
   results of these experiments point toward the possibility that the
   spores of C. crispa are dispersed at the end of the growing season and
   go through a dormancy until next spring.

AB S. arvensis typically shows variation in seed mass and colour. In this
   paper, results on the effects of these traits on seed germination under
   contrasting light incubation regimes and pre-chilling conditions are
   reported. The frequency of light brown and dark brown seeds and seed
   mass distribution among mass classes (0.06 mg in size) for each colour
   variant were measured on an S. arvensis population harvested in June
   1996, in Italy. For each variant, seven seed mass categories averaging
   1.03, 1.15, 1.34, 1.44, 1.51, 1.63 and 1.81 mg/seed were selected for
   the determination of percentage coat (testa) mass on total seed mass and
   germination behaviour. Germination tests were carried out in spring 1997
   in a four-level factorial experiment combining: (1) seven seed mass
   categories as above; (2) two seed colours (light brown or dark brown);
   (3) two seed pre-treatments (pre-chilling at 4°C for 7 days or no
   pre-chilling); (4) two light incubation regimes (11 h light+13 h dark
   daily cycles or continuous dark). Seeds were incubated at 20°C for 21
   (non-pre-chilled) or 14 (pre-chilled) days. In the population, dark
   brown seeds were 31% heavier and 3.5 times less frequent than light
   brown seeds, which were primarily present in lighter mass categories.
   Percentage coat mass decreased in light brown seeds with an average mass
   of >1.34 mg/seed, while it remained unchanged in dark brown seeds.
   Percentage germination was unaffected by mass in light brown seeds,
   while it was lower in dark brown seeds of higher mass categories. Lower
   germination of heavier dark brown seeds was likely due to thicker coat.
   Pre-chilling and light had relatively little effect on germination,
   although mean germination time was lower for unchilled seeds. Heavier
   dark brown seeds of S. arvensis tested are those likely to constitute a
   persistent soil seed bank, while lighter dark brown and light brown
   seeds constitute the fraction most suited to establish in the field.

AB The effects of stratification, BA, thiourea, and GA(3) were examined on
   germination of Liatris spicata (L.) Willd. seed. Seeds were germinated
   at 20 degreesC and numbers of germinated seed were counted daily for 21
   days. The final germination percentage (G) for seeds stored dry at 4
   degreesC for 0 to 10 weeks ranged from 52% to 64%, while stratification
   at 4 degreesC for 10 weeks increased G to 98% and decreased the days to
   50% of final germination (T-50) and the days between 10% and 90%
   germination (T-90-T-10). Aqueous solutions of BA at 10 or 100 mg.L-1
   applied to blotter paper increased G and decreased T-50 but did not
   affect T-90-T-10. In a separate experiment, dry seeds were treated for 3
   minutes in BA at 0 to 1126 mg.L-1 dissolved in acetone. G values
   increased quadratically, whereas T-50 and T-90-T-10 values decreased
   quadratically in response to BA concentration. A 3-minute preplant
   acetone permeation of seeds with BA at 225 or 1127 mg.L-1 yielded G and
   T-50 values similar to those obtained with 10 weeks of stratification.
   Seeds immersed in thiourea at 0.76 or 7.61 mg.L-1 for 24 hours prior to
   sowing had higher G and lower T-50 values than controls (0 mg.L-1
   thiourea), but T-90-T-10 values were similar for all treatments. Seeds
   treated with GA(3) at 1, 10, or 100 mg.L-1 in H2O did not differ from
   controls (0 mg.L-1 GA(3)) in G, T-50, or T-90-T-10. Infusion of BA via
   acetone may be a practical means of breaking seed dormancy and
   accelerating germination in L. spicata. Chemical names used:
   N-(phenylmethyl)-1H-purine-6-amine [benzyladenine (BA)]; gibberellic
   acid (GA(3)); thiocarbamide (thiourea).

AB A study was undertaken to analyse the allelochemicals in Melia dubia
   Cav. leaf litter and to test the allelopathic proclivity of aqueous leaf
   extracts and leaf litter on germination and early growth, and biomass of
   chilli (Capsicum frutescens L.) and eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) in
   laboratory and pot culture bioassay. A separate pot experiment was
   conducted to examine the allelopathic effect of leaf litter on growth,
   biomass and fruit yield of test crops. Gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of M. dubia leaf litter revealed many
   compounds, which were phenolic acids and their derivatives, alkaloids,
   methyl ketones (volatile allelochemical), unsaturated fatty acids,
   omega-3 fatty acid, aromatic ketone, chromene and others. The leaf
   aqueous extract and leaf litter inhibited the germination traits
   (germination per cent, mean daily germination, peak value, germination
   value and germination rate index) as well as early growth and biomass of
   both the test crops in laboratory bioassay and pot culture. The
   inhibitory effect was higher in laboratory bioassay as compared to pot
   culture. However, in pot experiments, none of the leaf litter treatments
   significantly affected the later growth, biomass and fruit yield. The
   allelochemicals detected in leaf litter of M. dubia, thus, have
   ephemeral allelopathic proclivity. Allelochemicals might have diluted
   through cultural practices or due to their ephemeral nature and, hence,
   allelopathic effect was only seen in germination and early stage of
   growth and it disappeared in later stage of growth and fruit yield of
   test crops. Hence, M. dubia is suggested for growing in different
   agroforestry systems.

   Tomato. However, the results of pot experiment carried out till maturity
   of test crops showed that there was no significant allelopathic effects
   of leaf litter on growth, biomass and fruit yield of both the test
   crops. The allelochemicals inhibited the germination, initial growth and
   biomass of chilli and tomato in petridish bioassay and pot experiments.
   However, in pot experiments conducted up to maturity of test crops, the
   effect of allelochemicals might have diluted through cultural practices
   like regular watering. The detected allelochemicals are ephemeral in
   nature hence; there was no allelopathic effect of leaf litter of M.
   azedarach on growth, biomass and fruit yield of chilli and tomato. It is
   evident from these results that chilli and tomato can be successfully
   cultivated under canopy of chinaberry without any deleterious effect.

   seed quality (germination determined by a seed testing laboratory), and
   temperature used by the seed testing laboratory to determine seed
   quality.  The model simulated daily germination as percent of the total
   number of seeds sown. Germination data observed by Boyer et al. (1987)
   in 1984 at Jake Stauffer Alabama Forestry Commission nursery near
   Opelika, Alabama, was used to test the model. The cumulative germination
   curve predicted by the model closely followed the observed data, An
   analysis of the model indicated that the predicted germination rate was
   more sensitive to the input values of sowing depth, length of seed
   stratification period, laboratory determined germination, and amount of
   mulch than to the other model input parameters.

   144.Germination is one of the most important processes in the life-cycle
   of a plant species. With the present study the series on investigation
   of germination biology of rare species from xerothermic grasslands and
   dry, ruderal influenced habitats should be proceeded. The following
   species of the family Fabaceae were investigated: Anthyllis
   vulneraria,Genista tinctoria, Hippocrepis comosa, Lotus corniculants, L.
   maritimus, Onobrychis arenaria, Securigera varia,Vicia hirsta, V
   tenuifolia and V tetrasperma.The germination experiments were carried
   out under three temperature-light regimes (8 / 4 degrees C, 20 / 10 C,
   32 / 20 C; 12 h light : 12 h darkness; 45 days), simulating climate
   conditions in spring, summer and autumn. The collected seeds were
   divided in two parts. Germination experiment of the first part was
   carried out in the year of harvest. The second part of diaspores was
   buried in soil from November till March, to ensure hibernation until the
   next experimental phase in following spring. Seed viability was tested
   before and after the experiments.The results show that, with exception
   of Onobtychis arenaria, all species had a strong dormancy, which was not
   or only marginally broken by natural stratification of hibernation.
   Anthyllis vulneraria,Hippocrepis comosa, Securigera varia and Vicia
   tetrasperma were nearly fully dormant, while Genista tinctoria, Lotus
   corniculatus, L. maritimus, Vicia hirsuta and V tenuifolia had between
   ca. 70 and 90% dormant seeds. The germination success was equally low in
   the year of harvest as after hibernation, only the commencement of
   germination was earlier after hibernation. The change of temperature had
   no or less significant effect on germination percentage and velocity:
   the species germinated on a broad range of temperature from cold to warm
   and hot conditions but with low germination rates. Significant
   interactions between temperature and hibernation were only found in
   Genista tinctoria, Vicia hirsuta and V tentuifolia.A correlation between
   germination behaviour and life-time of the species was not found, but
   there were significant positive interactions between germination
   percentage and velocity and the size and mass of the diaspores of the
   species of the family Fabaceae. However, without the data of Onobrychnis
   arenaria, the correlations were not significant.Germination behaviour
   and dormancy indicate a long-term persistent seed bank type of the
   investigated species. An exception is Onobrychis arenaria, which
   germinated in the year of harvest as well as after hibernation nearly
   completely under all three temperature-light-regimes. This species
   assigns to the transient seed bank type.Results suggest that it needs
   long-term investigation for restoration of grasslands by seed addition
   and experiments with the functional group of legumes because of the low
   germination of most species of the family Fabaceae.

AB Eastern black walnut (Juglans nigra L.) is used as a rootstock for the
   Persian walnut (Juglans regia L.) in some parts of the world and also
   has an important role in forestry and wood industry. Due to the deep
   physiological dormancy, the seed often shows an inconsistent or low
   germination percentage, making establishment difficult. This experiment
   was carried out as a completely randomized design with eight treatments
   and 16 replicates in a controlled greenhouse. The objective of this
   study was to determine the best treatment of breaking dormancy.
   Treatment groups consisted of seed priming with GA3 (400 and 800 ppm)
   solution for 24 hours, chilling stratification (one month and two
   months) and the combined treatments of chilling stratification and GA3.
   Results showed that the germination rate for separate application of
   both concentrations of GA3 and one month chilling treatment was zero, as
   no seeds germinated. The highest percentage of seed germination (69.27%)
   was recorded with the combined treatment of two months chilling and GA3
   (400 ppm). Also, this treatment showed significant differences for
   morphological, physiological and biochemical parameters compared to
   other treatments. It was found that the application of the combined
   treatment of chilling stratification and GA3 was effective in increasing
   seed germination percentage and rate as well as improving growth
   parameters of Eastern black walnut seedlings.

AB Breeding of new European plum (Prunus domestica L.) cultivars faces two
   major problems: low fruit set in cross-pollination and low germination
   rate of the seeds obtained from the harvested fruit. Up to now, breeding
   programs reported mainly stratification in peat, soil or sand and embryo
   culture according to Theiler (1971) in order to avoid the need of
   stratification and its associated problems, such as high losses due to
   microbial infection.
   The in vitro technique used in this study combines elements of different
   reported stratification methods and minimizes the infection rate during
   the stratification. Seeds were placed in a modified Murashige and Skoog
   (MS) medium in test tubes. Two seed treatments were tested: 1) sowing
   and stratification immediately after the harvest, 2) seeds were dried
   and stored for four months prior to sowing and stratification.
   Stratification was carried out in vitro at 4 inverted perpendicular C in
   both cases. Germination was checked once a week. When the radicle
   emerged through the surrounding tissues, seedlings were removed from the
   test tubes and cultivated in soil in the greenhouse. Some hard seed
   coats were removed manually to relieve the radical from the hardened
   testa and to encourage seeds germinate. The germination rate ranged from
   16-100%. By comparing the two treatments it is obvious that if the seeds
   are sown immediately after harvest, the germination percentage is
   higher.

   achieved with other treatments. The liquid endosperm of coconut also had
   favorable effect on the sprouting of corms under nursery conditions,

AB The effects of seed coat removal and chilling on the germination of
   seeds of ten cultivars of ornamental peach (Prunus persica Batsch) were
   investigated. Seeds were rinsed in running tap water for 48 h in order
   to facilitate seed coat removal. Only a few non-chilled, intact seeds
   germinated (e.g., 6% of 'Hito' seeds). Seed coat removal and no chilling
   resulted in some seed germination in eight of the ten cultivars, ranging
   from 6% to 83%. Chilling intact seeds at 5 C for up to 10 weeks resulted
   in greater frequencies of germination (average = 85% germination) than
   seed coat removal before (average = 80%) or after chilling (average =
   73%). There was a linear decrease in the germination percentage with an
   increase in abscisic acid (ABA) content for 'Yaguchi','Kanpaku', and
   'Kikumomo' seeds (R = -0.66; P < 0.001). The most consistent decrease in
   total seed ABA content (average of 64%) occurred during the 48 h rinsing
   period. In 'Kanpaku', dry seeds had an intermediate ABA content (13 ng
   per seed); but, in the embryonic axes, this increased from 0.03 ng to
   1.2 ng per seed with an increase in the duration of the chilling period.
   The lowest germination percentages were found in this cultivar. These
   results suggest that ABA synthesis in the embryonic axes during chilling
   may affect the varietal characteristic of seed dormancy, and that
   rinsing seeds for > 48 h could remove sufficient ABA to allow seed
   germination with minimum chilling.

AB Background: Seed dormancy is controlled by the physiological or
   structural properties of a seed and the external conditions. It is
   induced as part of the genetic program of seed development and
   maturation. Seeds with deep physiological embryo dormancy can be
   stimulated to germinate by a variety of treatments including cold
   stratification. Hormonal imbalance between germination inhibitors (e. g.
   abscisic acid) and growth promoters (e. g. gibberellins) is the main
   cause of seed dormancy breaking. Differences in the status of hormones
   would affect expression of genes required for germination. Proteomics
   offers the opportunity to examine simultaneous changes and to classify
   temporal patterns of protein accumulation occurring during seed dormancy
   breaking and germination. Analysis of the functions of the identified
   proteins and the related metabolic pathways, in conjunction with the
   plant hormones implicated in seed dormancy breaking, would expand our
   knowledge about this process.
   Results: A proteomic approach was used to analyse the mechanism of
   dormancy breaking in Norway maple seeds caused by cold stratification,
   and the participation of the abscisic (ABA) and gibberellic (GA) acids.
   Forty-four proteins showing significant changes were identified by mass
   spectrometry. Of these, eight spots were identified as water-responsive,
   18 spots were ABA- and nine GA-responsive and nine spots were regulated
   by both hormones. The classification of proteins showed that most of the
   proteins associated with dormancy breaking in water were involved in
   protein destination. Most of the ABA- and GA-responsive proteins were
   involved in protein destination and energy metabolism.
   Conclusion: In this study, ABA was found to mostly down-regulate
   proteins whereas GA up-regulated proteins abundance. Most of the changes
   were observed at the end of stratification in the germinated seeds. This
   is the most active period of dormancy breaking when seeds pass from the
   quiescent state to germination. Seed dormancy breaking involves proteins
   of various processes but the proteasome proteins, S-adenosylmethionine
   synthetase, glycine-rich RNA binding protein, ABI3-interacting protein
   1, EF-2 and adenosylhomocysteinase are of particular importance. The
   effect of exogenously applied hormones was not a determining factor for
   total inhibition (ABA) or stimulation (GA) of Norway maple seed dormancy
   breaking and germination but proteomic data has proven these hormones
   play a role.

AB Seeds of Juglans nigra stored for one year under 0-5°C were used to
   investigate the effects of stratification on seed water content,
   endogenous hormone content, germination and seedling growth. The period
   of stratification was highly required by the seeds of J. nigra for
   successful germination and later-on-vigour growth. It was slower for the
   seeds to absorb water during stratification. The seeds were ready to
   germinate at saturation. Higher seed water content before stratification
   promoted a shorter time to reach the saturation water content. The
   dormant seed contained lower level of GA3 and high ABA. During
   stratification, GA3 showed an obvious increase while ABA decreased
   sharply and finally reached zero. The rate of GA3 to ABA was considered
   a factor to control seed germination. Among the methods of
   stratification, soaking the seeds in water for 5-6 days and then
   stratifying them at 2-5°C for 120-150 days presented the best seed
   germination rate, as high as 75%. Although moisture absorption
   pretreatment could retard seed absorption moisture absorption treatments
   did not promote seed germination. Stratification under low temperature
   had a significant effect on seedling growth.

AB Rice growth is sensitive to low temperature. Chilling injury is one of
   the main natural disasters in rice cultivation, and is damaging to rice
   growth at all developmental stages. Low-temperature germinability (LTG)
   is an important trait for seedling establishment, especially in rice
   direct-sowing practice. However, the genetic mechanism of LTG remains
   elusive. Here, we report the mapping of QTLs controlling LTG in rice
   using 586 single segment substitution lines (SSSL) derived from 4
   AA-genome wild rice species. 21 SSSLs with the highest germination rate
   at low temperature in both of the two tested seasons were selected, from
   them 10 QTLs controlling LTG were identified by substitution mapping to
   locate on 6 chromosomes: chromosome 1, 3, 5, 7, 8 and 11, with an
   interval length of 3.45 to 20.15 cM. Five QTLs were detected from
   Niv-SSSls: qLTGn3-1, qLTGn5-1, qLTGn5-3, qLTGn7-1 and qLTGn7-2, their
   additive effects ranged from 3.72% to 19.74% in late season 2018.
   qLTGb1-1 and qLTGb8-2 were detected in the SSSLs with O. barthii as the
   donor and they accounted for at least 9.51% of the total phenotypic
   variation. Two QTLs, qLTGg5-2 and qLTGg8-1, were derived from O.
   glumaepatula, and their average additive effects were 4.28% and 20.39%
   in late seasons 2018, respectively. qLTGm11-1 on chromosome 11 was the
   only QTL identified from O. meridionalis. All QTLs derived from wild
   rice species improved low-temperature germination significantly. The
   SSSL library with wild rice species as donor is therefore a valuable
   resource for rice germplasm innovation and the breeding of
   chilling-resistant varieties.

   NOVELTY - A goldthread cultivation method involves selecting seed by
   taking berberine as seed and storing at room temperature. Nursery
   selection process is performed by selecting previously winter plowing
   nursery, mixing ashes or humus with seed, sowing the seeds, overlying
   long straw or pine needles, and improving seed germination rate.
   Thinning process is performed by growing the seedlings to true leaves.
   Weeding process is performed by removing weeds during berberine early
   seedling stage, slow growth and rapid growth stages and applying dry
   fertilizer, followed by transplanting and field managing.
                       USE - Method for cultivating goldthread.
   ADVANTAGE - The method enables cultivating goldthread with high yield
   and better quality, in a cost-effective manner.
   DETAILED DESCRIPTION - A goldthread cultivation method involves
   selecting seed by taking 3-4 years old berberine as seed with healthy
   and vigorous growth, full grain plumpness and germination rate, without
   impurities, and storing at room temperature under high shed wet sand
   stratification. Nursery selection process is performed by selecting
   previously winter plowing nursery, mixing 5-10 times the ashes or humus
   with seed until the seed is gray uniform color, sowing the seeds,
   overlying 3-4 cm long straw or pine needles, and improving seed
   germination rate of 20-25 pounds per acre. Thinning process is performed
   by growing the seedlings to 1-2 true leaves. Weeding process is
   performed by removing weeds during berberine early seedling stage, slow
   growth and rapid growth stages and applying 80-100 pounds per acre and
   50 kg dry fertilizer through applicator for twice when the seedlings
   grow to 3-4 true leaves. Transplanting and field management processes
   are performed by selecting origin of the deep forests without direct
   sunlight and a steady flow to absorb nutrients from the soil, taking a
   lot of organic fertilizer, improving soil structure and soil fertility,
   crop rotation for more than one year, where the crop is carrots and
   sweet potatoes, carrying out wasteland cultivation method by plowing the
   soil before planting even one winter, in the middle of each plot planted
   a row pile with longitudinal distance of 2-2.3 m, where the lower end of
   the pile of soil is 30 cm deep, the upper end above the ground is
   1.5-1.6 m and longitudinally placing the bamboo on shelves as cover
   material, planting seedling in early February, preparing seedling by
   transplanting with soil, avoiding water, where planting density is 4-4.5

AB The introduction to the paper gives an account of hualo (Nothofagus
   glauca) in central-south Chile, at the interface between the
   Mediterranean and temperate climatic zones, between the Maule and
   Valdivia rivers. Three types of treatment were applied to seeds
   collected in 2000 season in Region VII of Chile: stratification in moist
   sand at 2-4°C for 4, 6 or 8 days; immersion in 1% thiourea for 2 ,4 or 6
   days; and immersion in 200, 400 or 600 ppm gibberellic acid (GA3) for 3
   days. Germination capacity over 30 days, and germination time and value
   were measured after germinating the treated seeds at a controlled
   temperature using sand as substrate. The highest germination percentage
   over 30 days was in the 200 ppm GA3 treatment, followed by the 6-day
   stratification treatment and the 400 ppm GA3 treatment. Germination in
   all these treatments reached around 60%, compared with 5% in control,
   untreated seeds. Germination value followed the same pattern. All the
   pretreatments increased germination to some degree.

AB Aims
   Seeds of Rumex crispus from six provenances were studied in relation to
   their germination under drought and presence of nitrogen in the
   germination and emergence media. We also investigated whether adaptation
   to soil increases the ability of the species to colonize and establish
   in contrasting environments along a longitudinal gradient in western
   Spain by means of a reciprocal transplantation experiment.
   Methods
   We conducted a germination trial in the lab to test for the germination
   responses to water scarcity along a polyethylene glycol gradient and to
   varying concentrations of nitrogen compounds. Simultaneously reciprocal
   transplantations experiment was conducted, where seeds from six
   provenances were grown in the soils from the very same provenances.
   Seedling emergence, survivorship and fitness-related variables were
   measured in all plots.
   Important Findings
   We found that R. crispus has a cold-stratification requirement that
   enhances its germination. Significant differences between the six
   provenances were detected for time-to-germination, total seedling
   emergence, plant mortality and reproductive effort in all the
   experiments. The differences between provenances with respect to
   germination were confirmed by the significant statistical analyses of
   the variance, thus providing evidence that seeds from parent plants
   grown in different environmental conditions have an intrinsically
   different abilities to germinate and establish. Soil nitrogen content
   where seed germination and seedlings establish also play an important
   role in their performance in terms of survivorship and reproduction,
   being the higher levels of inorganic nitrogen and of microbial biomass
   those that increased biomass production, enhanced inflorescence
   formation and reduced plant mortality. We conclude that one of the main
   reasons for the spread and maintenance of R. crispus would be the
   increased levels of nitrogen in agricultural soils.

AB Gentiana lutea L. (yellow gentian, Gentianaceae) is an important
   medicinal plant under protection as endangered species in most European
   countries. The aim of this work was to evaluate variation in seed mass,
   seed water content, and seed germination among 56 wild accessions of G.
   lutea. The effect of gibberellic acid (GA(3)), putrescine, moist
   chilling, and level of ripeness of seeds on subsequent germination was
   also investigated. Seeds of G. lutea showed physiological dormancy
   (final germination percentages ranged from 0% to 11%, depending on the
   accession) and GA(3) enhanced seed germination drastically in all the
   accessions. The highest germination (99%) of GA(3)-treated seeds was
   reached at 15 degrees C. Final germination percentage and germination
   rate (as expressed by mean germination time), as well as seed mass and
   seed water content, varied significantly among accessions. In general, 1
   year moist chilling did not significantly enhance G. lutea seed
   germination. For most accessions, no significant differences were found
   between fully ripe seeds and less ripe seeds for seed water content,
   seed mass, and seed germination. Applications of GA(3) were always most
   effective than those of putrescine for increasing seed germination.

AB Helichrysum microphyllum subsp. tyrrhenicum (Asteraceae) is an endemic
   taxon of Sardinia and Corsica, where it grows at different altitudes.
   The objective of this study was to investigate the seed traits and
   germination behaviour of four Sardinian populations of this taxon
   located at different altitudes. Seed traits were evaluated, and
   germination tests were carried out by incubating seeds at a range of
   constant (5-30 degrees C) and alternating (25/10 degrees C)
   temperatures. The dry after-ripening (DAR) pre-treatment was also
   applied by storing seed in dry conditions for 3 months at 25 degrees C.
   Seed traits and germination behaviour data were statistically analysed
   to identify if there was a correlation with altitude. Differences in
   seed size, area and mass among populations were recorded, however, no
   relationship was found with altitude. High germination percentages were
   obtained in all populations, both in untreated and DAR seeds, and were
   positively affected by alternating temperatures. The final germination
   percentage and time required to reach 50% final germination (T-50)
   showed no relationship with altitude. The differences in seed traits and
   germination detected among the studied populations of H. microphyllum
   subsp. tyrrhenicum were not correlated with altitude. This study
   provides new and important knowledge for this taxon. H. microphyllum
   subsp. tyrrhenicum is characterised by high germination percentages and
   low T-50 values and does not seem to require any dormancy-breaking
   treatment. This species represents a high-potential native plant species
   that should be considered within environmental management plans.

AB Each taxon is characterized by a temperature range over which seed
   germination is possible and this may vary in space and time in relation
   to climate and ecological conditions. We used thermal modelling to test
   the hypothesis that thermal thresholds for seed germination can predict
   germination timing of Mediterranean species along an altitudinal and
   environmental gradient. Seeds of 18 species were collected in Sardinia
   from sea level to 1810 m above sea level, and germination tests were
   carried out at a range of constant (5 to 25 degrees C) and alternating
   (25/10 degrees C) temperatures. Different dormancy-breaking treatments
   [gibberellic acid (GA(3)), cold (C) and warm (W) stratifications and dry
   after ripening (DAR)] were applied. The annual pattern of soil
   temperatures was recorded using 24 data-loggers buried close to the
   study species. The logged soil temperatures distinguished 'Mediterranean
   lowland' from 'Mediterranean mountain' species. Although germination was
   >50% in untreated seeds of most species, GA(3) had a positive effect in
   all species. C either inhibited or had a neutral effect on germination,
   W did not enhanced seed germination, while DAR had a positive effect
   only in species from coastal environments. The thermal time constant (S)
   for 50% germination ranged from 22 to 357 degrees Cd (degree days) above
   base temperatures (T-b) of -9 to 9 degrees C, depending on species and
   treatments. Mediterranean lowland species had lower T-b values compared
   with upland species. This study revealed significant differences in
   germination thresholds of Mediterranean lowland and mountain species in
   relation to T-b and S that probably have an impact on germination timing
   in the field and niche competitiveness.

AB Each plant species has particular requirements for seed germination, and
   some of them respond differently to constant or alternating temperature
   regimes. In this study, the interchangeable effects of different
   treatments and temperatures on the completion of seed germination of
   Clematis vitalba L. were investigated. The seeds were tested with a
   constant (from 5 degrees C to 25 degrees C) or a fluctuating (25/10
   degrees C) temperature regime, and the effect of gibberellic acid
   (GA(3)), incubation at warm (W) or cold (C) temperatures while being
   imbibed, and drying after ripening (DAR) were evaluated. The final
   germination percentages and the time in days required to reach 50% of
   germination (T-50) were calculated. GA(3) and C significantly enhanced
   completion of seed germination at all of the temperatures tested. A
   strong positive effect of alternating temperature was observed, which
   triggered completion of seed germination regardless of treatment. Under
   the fluctuating temperature, the chilled seeds had the most rapid
   germination. Low germination rates were observed for both control and
   DAR treatments. Seeds of C. vitalba display a certain degree of
   dormancy, which can be broken by moist chilling and GA(3) treatments.
   Moreover, alternating temperature stimulates the completion of seed
   germination by satisfying certain physiological requirements for
   germination under constant temperatures.

AB Phloridzin, phloretin and chlorogenic acid were the main phenolic
   substances in the seed. Phloridzin was abundant in the coats, but not in
   the embryos, of dry Bancroft and Antonovka seeds; during stratification
   it became abundant in the embryos. Phloretin was always present in the
   seed coat but never in the embryo. Chlorogenic acid, abundant in the dry
   seed coat, disappeared when seeds were placed on wet filter paper,
   though not at a rate related to germination rate (which varied with
   temperature). Removal of the seed coats from Idared seeds had little
   effect, but removal of the endosperm greatly increased germination rate.
   A non-phenolic inhibitor isolated from seed coats of non-stratified
   Wealthy and Antonovka seeds strongly inhibited growth of wheat
   coleoptiles and was probably identical with the abscisin II previously
   found in apple leaves and fruit juice [see H.A., 38: 2712]; it had the
   same Rf value (0.65-0.74) as synthetic abscisin II. After stratification
   this inhibitor disappeared almost completely from the integuments.

AB The aim of this study was to determine the best treatment to use to
   overcome dormancy and to maximize germination of Carpinus betulus and C.
   orientalis seeds. In both species the effect of warm stratification
   (WS), cold stratification (CS) and gibberellic acid (GA(3)) application
   on seed germination was investigated. Seeds of both species were
   subjected to WS (20-25 degrees C) for 0, 1 and 2 months and then cold
   stratified at 3-5 degrees C for 0, 1. 2, 3 or 4 months (1st experiment)
   or treated with 500, 1000 or 2000ppm GA(3) for 30 hours and then cold
   stratified at 3-5 degrees C for 0, 1. 2, 3 and 4 months (2nd
   experiment). In the first experiment, in both species, no germination
   was observed in seeds subjected to only 1 or 2 months of WS and up to 2
   months CS alone resulted in very low seed germination. In C. betulus,
   the combination of WS and CS improved seed germination. Seeds given a
   period of 1 or 2 months of WS prior to CS, germinated to higher (P <
   0.05) percentages than those subjected to only CS. In contrast, in C.
   orientalls seeds an increase of WS period from 1 to 2 months, prior to
   CS treatment (2, 3 or 4 months), significantly decreased (P < 0.05)
   germination percentages. Results of the second experiment showed that
   GA(3) application, prior to CS, was more effective in improving
   germination in C. betulus than C. orientalis. In C. betulus, GA(3)
   application entirely replaced the requirement for WS and shortened the
   required CS period, resulting in satisfactory gemination percentages. In
   C. orientalis, the GA(3) treatment significantly improved germination of
   seeds cold stratified for 2 or 3 months, but germination percentages
   were significantly less (P < 0.05) than those of seeds subjected to only
   4 months CS. In both species, the treatments that gave germination
   percentages >= 70% (in both experiments) exhibited a reduction of mean
   germination time (MGT) with an increase in CS period.

AB A germination experiment was carried out in the laboratory to evaluate
   the effect of stratification on seed germination of Jasminus fruticans.
   Nine different treatments were used to break the embryo imposed
   dormancy. Seeds were subjected to warm stratification (20/25 degrees C)
   for 1 or 2 months, cold stratification (2-4 degrees C) for 1, 2 or 3
   months and to the following warm plus cold stratification combinations:
   I month warm plus I month cold stratification (1W+1C), 1 month warm plus
   2 months cold stratification (1W+2C), 2 months warm plus 1 month cold
   stratification (2W+1C) or 2 months warm plus 2 months cold
   stratification (2W+2C). Maximum germination (86.00%) and minimum mean
   germination time (11.26 days) were attained after 3 months of cold
   stratification without warm stratification. Seeds that were subjected to
   2 months cold stratification exhibited 70.50% germination, whereas those
   stratified for 1W+2C or 2W+2C exhibited 69.00 or 67.50%, respectively.
   One month of cold stratification resulted in a germination percentage
   equal to 21%, whereas seeds that were subjected to warm stratification
   for 1 or 2 months prior to 1 month cold stratification gave germination
   percentages equal to 18.50 and 20.00%, respectively. None of the control
   seeds or those that were warm stratified for 1 or 2 months germinated.
   Results revealed that several months of cold stratification (3 months)
   were required to overcome physiological dormancy and to enhance Jasminus
   fruticans seed germination.

AB For Corylus avellana, pericarp permeability, seed desiccation tolerance,
   and the effect of warm and cold moist stratification combinations on
   germination and of outdoor sowing date on dormancy breaking and seedling
   emergence were investigated. Seeds with (intact fruit nut) and without
   the pericarp were subjected to an imbibition test, and water uptake was
   measured. After nuts had been stored for 5 months at 3-5 degrees C,
   seeds and desiccated seeds were cold-stratified at 3-5 degrees C (for 0,
   1, 2 or 3 months), then tested for germination. Nuts were
   warm-stratified at 20-25 degrees C (for 0, 1 or 2 months), then
   cold-stratified (for 0, 1, 2 or 3 months) and tested for seed
   germination. The nuts were sown outdoors on three dates in the same year
   of their collection: 15 September (immediately after collection), 2
   November, and 17 December, and emerged seedlings were counted the
   following spring. The pericarp was not a barrier to water uptake by the
   seed; however, the seeds imbibed water faster and had more mass when the
   pericarp was removed. Seeds tolerated desiccation; germination
   percentage was not reduced when seed moisture content was reduced to
   8.71%. Germination of seeds without the pericarp (regardless of the
   moisture content) was the highest when the seeds were cold-stratified
   for 2 months. When seeds with the pericarp were tested for germination,
   2 months of warm stratification before a 2-month cold stratification
   maximized seed germination. For outdoor sowing of nuts, sowing date
   affected percentage of seedling emergence the following spring; early
   autumn sowing (immediately after collection) resulted in the best
   emergence.

AB Rose breeders need reliable and efficient germination protocols to
   exploit all viable embryos in their breeding programme. A combined
   physical restriction of the seed coat and a physiological dormancy are
   present in the achenes of hybrid tea roses resulting in variable and not
   uniform seed germination. In this study, different treatment
   combinations were assessed to overcome the mechanical resistence of the
   pericarp and enhance germination. Both chemical and microbial seed
   scarification were carried out. A mild scarification with sodium
   hypochlorite (NaOCl) before stratification promoted a more uniform
   germination and enhanced the percentage of germination from 49.2% to
   65.9%. Epiphytic bacteria, Emercal (TM) (a product composed by bacteria
   and co-metabolites produced by bacterial fermentation), or Remedier (R)
   (a commercial formulation of Trichoderma harzianum and Trichoderma
   viridae), added to the stratification sand, enhanced percentage of
   germinated seeds but had no effect on the uniformity of germination.
   Addition of a compost activator to the stratification sand did not
   improve seed germination. After stratification, pre-sowing treatments
   with GA(3) were carried out. Immersion of stratified seeds in 1 g l(-1)
   GA(3) highly enhanced percentage of seed germination (77.6%), mean
   germination time (26.0 days) and uniformity of germination (2.5%)
   compared to immersion in water (respectively 64.8%, 32.8 days and 7.9%).
   Therefore, this study proposes a combination of treatments as a reliable
   optimisation of seed germination protocols for hybrid tea roses.

AB Plant growth promoting bacteria make differences in plant growth by
   different mechanisms which can be mediated by direct or indirect
   methods. Nowadays these bacteria can be used as natural bio fertilizers
   instead of synthetic fertilizers and dramatically reduce the
   environmental hazards. Root colonizing bacteria have the ability to
   increase the seed germination rate, growth of plant and yield of crops.
   Therefore present study was performed in order to find out the effect of
   one of the soil borne gram (-) ve, chemoorganotrophic, facultative
   anaerobic bacteria Serratia marcescens on seed germination of some
   selected healthy plant seeds varieties, Vigna mungo (black gram), Vigna
   radiata (green gram), Vigna uniculata (long bean), Hibiscus esculentus
   (lady's finger), Cucurbita maxima (pumpkin), Capsicum annum (chilli) and
   Solanum melongena (brinjal), which were collected from Agrarian service
   center, Thirunelvely, Jaffna, Srilanka. Twelve surface sterilized seeds
   were placed into X * 107 cells/mL concentration of 75 mL bacterial
   suspension and soaked for overnight separately then seeds were
   transferred to sterile petridishes which containing sterile moistened
   filter paper and kept in dark at room temperature for 3-5 days, where
   sterile distilled water was used as control. By using above method, this
   study was also carried out for various soaking time intervals, (0,2,4
   and 6 hours) and for different bacterial concentrations (X * 107
   cells/mL - X * 102 cells/mL). Finally the mean length of developed germ
   tube was measured separately and the results were subjected to analysis
   of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey test at p=0.05 using statistical software
   minitab (version16). The analysis showed that the growth of C. annum and
   V. radiata were not affected by S. marcescens while the growth of V.
   mungo, H. esculentus, C. maxima and S. melongena were promoted by the
   bacterium. Unfortunately the germination of V. uniculata was suppressed
   by the bacterium for overnight soaking. Moreover, long bean, brinjal,
   black gram and lady's finger exhibited optimum growth rate at 2 hours
   soaking period whereas, the development of germ tube for chilli revealed
   maximum rate at 4 hours soaking time. The concentration of bacteria at X
   * 103 cells/mL and X * 104 cells/mL were found as the optimum for the
   better growth of pumpkin and green gram respectively. Rest of the tested
   seeds exhibited highest growth activity at X * 102 cells/mL
   concentration. Therefore it was concluded that the bacterial activity on
   seed germination varied among the seed varieties, soaking time period
   and inoculum concentration. Hence, this study reveals the primary
   platform for the practical benefits of employing S. marcescens for a
   sustainable farming system.

AB The aim of the present study was to investigate whether seeds of six
   native fruit trees from southern Brazil had some kind of dormancy, as
   well as to verify the existence or not of photoblastism in them. The
   work was carried out at the Laboratory of Plant Physiology of the
   Federal Technological University of Parana - Dois Vizinhos Campus. The
   influence of photoperiod factors and techniques for overcoming dormancy
   were tested on the germination of Eugenia uniflora L. (spice), Plinia
   trunciflora (jabuticabeira), Plinia cauliflora (jabuticabeira hybrid),
   Eugenia involucrata DC. (Cerjeira do Rio Grande), Myrcianthes pungens
   (guabijuzeiro) and Campomanesia guazumifolia (seven capoteiro). The
   treatments were the interactions of these two levels of factors. Seeds
   were exposed in total darkness condition or 24 hours photoperiod.
   Techniques of immersion in gibberellic acid solution (200 mg L-1) were
   also submitted; stratification at 5°C for 30 days; immersion in water at
   room temperature for 24 hours; immersion in hot water (80°C) for five
   minutes; immersion in sulfuric acid solution (96%) for five minutes; and
   manual physical scarification with 120 sandpaper. The seeds were also
   tested without the use of any technique, constituting the control
   treatment. The experimental design was completely randomized, in a 2 x 7
   factorial scheme (brightness x treatment to break dormancy), with four
   replicates of 100 seeds. After 60 days, germination (%) was analyzed.
   the accumulated germination percentage, the germination speed index and
   the average germination time. The seeds of most native species studied
   do not show dormancy or photoblastism, except for "sete capoteiro" which
   supposedly have morphophysiological dormancy, with negative
   photoblastism. The use of hot water or sulfuric acid on the seeds of
   native fruit trees is not recommended.

   after-ripening of apple seeds, developed at the Warsaw Agricultural
   University, for raising seedlings in a breeding process. Apples of
   'Golden Delicious', 'Ligol' and 'Melrose', obtained from twelve
   different cross combinations, were harvested in October and stored at
   2-3°C till February. Then seeds were removed from fruits and sown
   individually in trays filled with moist sphagnum peat, enriched with
   nutrients. Trays were placed in cold storage at 2-3°C for 59 days and
   then transferred to an unheated plastic tunnel. Germination was recorded
   daily and germination rate expressed as an average number of days
   required for emergence of cotyledons. A similar treatment was applied to
   pear seeds obtained from four interspecific cross combinations,
   involving cultivars belonging to Pyrus communis L. and to Pyrus
   pyrifolia Nakai. In total, 2880 apple and 960 pear seeds were
   investigated. Percentage of germinating apple and pear seeds was high
   (86.7-97.1%). Seeds germinated very fast, within 2.5-4.2 days. The
   presented method is easy to apply, does not require drying of seeds and
   provides a high output of seedlings in a short time after
   stratification.

   samples collected in 2016 in Poland. We aimed to test the hypothesis
   that the low temperature exposure decreases the final percentage and
   speed of seed germination in the hybrid and its parental species. For
   each species, sets of 100 achenes in three replications were mixed with
   dry sand and stored in Petri dishes in darkness for 12 weeks, at -18
   degrees C and + 4 degrees C, and + 25 degrees C. The seeds were
   incubated for 21 d at room temperature (+25 degrees C), under the 12 h
   photoperiod (630 1x). We showed a lack of significant differences in:
   (i) the final percentage of germinated seeds of studied species stored
   at the same conditions, (ii) the final percentage of germinated seeds
   between the applied stratification conditions in the hybrid and its
   parental species, and (iii) the mean values of Timson's index, mean
   germination time, and coefficient of velocity of germination between the
   stratification conditions in each species. The statistically significant
   inter-specific differences in the mean germination time parameter after
   the +25 degrees C treatment suggest that the seeds of S. x niederederi
   are able to germinate faster than the seeds of its parental species.
   However, to improve our knowledge of naturalization and invasion
   abilities of S. x niederederi by sexual reproduction, the seed
   germination and seedling survival of the hybrid should be tested in the
   field.

AB Several studies have confirmed the alpha-synuclein real-time
   quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay to have high sensitivity and
   specificity for Parkinson's disease. However, whether the assay can be
   used as a robust, quantitative measure to monitor disease progression,
   stratify different synucleinopathies and predict disease conversion in
   patients with idiopathic REM sleep behaviour disorder remains
   undetermined. The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic value
   of CSF alpha-synuclein RT-QuIC quantitative parameters in regard to
   disease progression, stratification and conversion in synucleinopathies.
   We performed alpha-synuclein RT-QuIC in the CSF samples from 74
   Parkinson's disease, 24 multiple system atrophy and 45 idiopathic REM
   sleep behaviour disorder patients alongside 55 healthy controls,
   analysing quantitative assay parameters in relation to clinical data.
   alpha-Synuclein RT-QuIC showed 89% sensitivity and 96% specificity for
   Parkinson's disease. There was no correlation between RT-QuIC
   quantitative parameters and Parkinson's disease clinical scores (e.g.
   Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor), but RT-QuIC positivity
   and some quantitative parameters (e.g. V-max) differed across the
   different phenotype clusters. RT-QuIC parameters also added value
   alongside standard clinical data in diagnosing Parkinson's disease. The
   sensitivity in multiple system atrophy was 75%, and CSF samples showed
   longer T-50 and lower V-max compared to Parkinson's disease. All RT-QuIC
   parameters correlated with worse clinical progression of multiple system
   atrophy (e.g. change in Unified Multiple System Atrophy Rating Scale).
   The overall sensitivity in idiopathic REM sleep behaviour disorder was
   64%. In three of the four longitudinally followed idiopathic REM sleep
   behaviour disorder cohorts, we found around 90% sensitivity, but in one
   sample (DeNoPa) diagnosing idiopathic REM sleep behaviour disorder
   earlier from the community cases, this was much lower at 39%. During
   follow-up, 14 of 45 (31%) idiopathic REM sleep behaviour disorder
   patients converted to synucleinopathy with 9/14 (64%) of convertors
   showing baseline RT-QuIC positivity.
   In summary, our results showed that alpha-synuclein RT-QuIC adds value
   in diagnosing Parkinson's disease and may provide a way to distinguish
   variations within Parkinson's disease phenotype. However, the
   quantitative parameters did not correlate with disease severity in
   Parkinson's disease. The assay distinguished multiple system atrophy
   patients from Parkinson's disease patients and in contrast to
   Parkinson's disease, the quantitative parameters correlated with disease
   progression of multiple system atrophy. Our results also provided
   further evidence for alpha-synuclein RT-QuIC having potential as an
   early biomarker detecting synucleinopathy in idiopathic REM sleep
   behaviour disorder patients prior to conversion. Further analysis of
   longitudinally followed idiopathic REM sleep behaviour disorder patients
   is needed to better understand the relationship between alpha-synuclein
   RT-QuIC signature and the progression from prodromal to different
   synucleinopathies.

AB In the education of Agricultural EngineerS, practical application of
   what have been learned from lectures is of great importance. In so
   doing, students not only acquire experience but also understand the
   practical applications of theories. Before graduation senior students
   are required to finish a graduation project on his/her own in their last
   year, which is considered a major stage before their graduation. This
   stage helps them to focus on a particular subject, carry out a project
   based on scientific principles, and find a job easier in the particular
   subject area. In addition, those who want to continue their higher
   education through a Master of Science, will have knowledge of the next
   step. In order to graduate, students of the Department of Horticulture
   have to finish the project successfully. To do this, throughout the two
   semesters, they have to choose a subject, do a literature search, set an
   experiment in gardens, carry out laboratory analysis, interpret the
   results and finally present them scientifically. For example, students
   of horticulture have investigated the effect of different stratification
   periods on germination rate of apricot and walnut seeds as well as
   adaptation of some apricot, peach and Loquat cultivars to Mediterranean
   Conditions. Consequently, graduation project appears to be one of the
   indispensable courses of Agricultural Engineering education and should
   be kept that way.

   stratification period, as well as the application of the type of

   influence of the germination of yellow araca tree seeds. A DIC
   experiment was performed in the triple multifactor arrangement
   [stratification period x type of solution x immersion time in the
   solution]. Five stratification periods (0, 5, 10, 15, 20 days), five
   types of immersion solution (none, H2O, NaClO 5%, GA(3) 100 mg L-1,
   GA(3) 300 mg L-1) and three immersion in solution (six, 12 and 24 hours)
   with four replicates of 100 seeds. Germination, germination velocity
   index (IVG) and average germination time (TMG) were evaluated. GA(3)
   show efficient promoter for rapid germination of arachis seeds.
   Stratification is only recommended for yellow seedlings if not
   associated with the use of GA(3). The stratification periods may have
   the vigor of the affected seeds if they increase the soaking times in

AB The aim of the present work was to investigate the effects of
   osmoconditioning on chilling injury in soybean (Glycine max (L,) Merr,)
   seeds during imbibition. Soybean seeds germinated readily over a large
   range of temperatures (10-35 degreesC), the thermal optimum being 25-30
   degreesC. Low temperatures reduced the germination rate and no seed
   germinated at 1 degreesC. Pre-treatment of seeds at 1 degreesC reduced
   further germination at the optimal temperature (25 degreesC), This
   deleterious effect of chilling increased with duration of the treatment,
   and was maximal after 4 days. Osmoconditioning of seeds at 20 degreesC
   with a polyethylene glycol-8000 solution at - 1.5 MPa for at least 24 h
   followed by drying back the seeds to their initial moisture content
   reduced their chilling sensitivity and even allowed germination at 1
   degreesC. Chilling of control seeds resulted in a sharp decline in in
   vivo ACC-dependent ethylene production and in an increase in electrolyte
   leakage in the medium, which indicated deterioration of membrane
   properties, Osmoconditioned seeds placed at 1 degreesC did not show any
   reduction in their ability to convert ACC to ethylene nor any strong
   increase in electrolyte leakage. Imbibition of both control and
   osmoconditioned seeds at 1 degreesC resulted in a marked increase in ATP
   level (more than 50% of the total nucleotides) and energy charge;
   however, the latter cannot be considered as an indicator of chilling
   since it remained high (0.74-0.88) throughout the cold treatment.
   Chilling treatment longer than 6 days induced accumulation of
   malondialdehyde in the embryonic axis, which was more marked in control
   seeds than in osmoconditioned seeds, suggesting that chilling
   sensitivity was associated with lipid peroxidation. Imbibition of seeds
   at 1 degreesC resulted in an increase in superoxide dismutase, catalase
   and glutathione reductase activity, which was generally higher in
   osmoconditioned seeds than in control ones. This stimulation of the
   antioxidant defence systems occurred during the 4 first days of chilling
   and decreased then in control seeds while it remained high in
   osmoconditioned ones. Re-warming seeds at 250C resulted in an increase
   in all enzyme activity involved in antioxidant defence. However this
   effect of re-warming decreased in control seeds after 4 days of
   chilling, whereas it was maintained in osmoconditioned seeds.

EA JAN 2022
PY 2022
AB Background and Aims Seed dormancy determines the environmental niche of
   plants in seasonal environments, and has consequences for plant
   performance that potentially go far beyond the seed and seedling stages.
   In this study, we examined the cascading effects of seed dormancy on the
   expression of subsequent life-history traits and fitness in the annual
   herb Arabidopsis thaliana. Methods We planted seeds of >200 recombinant
   inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between two locally adapted
   populations (Italy and Sweden), and both parental genotypes at the
   native site of the Swedish population in three consecutive years. We
   quantified the relationship between primary seed dormancy and the
   expression of subsequent life-history traits and fitness in the RIL
   population with path analysis. To examine the effects of differences in
   dormancy on the relative fitness of the two parental genotypes, we
   planted dormant seeds during the seed dispersal period and non-dormant
   seeds during the germination period of the local population. Key Results
   In the RIL population, strong primary dormancy was associated with high
   seedling survival, but with low adult survival and fecundity, and path
   analysis indicated that this could be explained by effects on
   germination timing, rosette size and flowering start. The relationship
   between primary seed dormancy and germination proportion varied among
   years, and this was associated with differences in seasonal changes in
   soil moisture. The planting of dormant and non-dormant seeds indicated
   that the lower primary dormancy of the local Swedish genotype
   contributed to its higher germination proportion in two years and to its
   higher fecundity in one year. Conclusions Our results show that seed
   dormancy affects trait expression and fitness components across the life
   cycle, and suggest that among-year variation in the incidence of drought
   during the germination period should be considered when predicting the
   consequences of climatic change for population growth and evolution.

AB In modern sustainable grazing systems, there is an increased emphasis on
   the use of nontraditional forages and local varieties to supply
   nutrients to livestock. Low availability of forage early in the growing
   season and low nutritive value in the summer could limit animal
   production in Alentejo. The main goal of these studies is to assess
   local populations of chicory (Cichorium intybus) in view of their
   propagation to use as grazed forage with medicinal purposes. Seeds from
   10 accessions of C. intybus were collected in the Alentejo region in
   September 2009 and stored at room temperature (ca. 20 degrees C). Seeds
   were chilled at 5 degrees C for 7 days or stored at room temperature (20
   degrees C) (control). Germination trials were performed in light and
   temperature controlled thermostats, at 20 degrees C at total darkness
   and at 12-h daily photoperiod. Best germination results were observed in
   light and without seed dormancy break treatment: accession 61/2009E with
   53,5% at 20 degrees C at light, without seed dormancy break treatment.
   Accessions 6/2009E and 64/2009E also had a high germination rate. The
   rest of the accessions gave germination values under 40%. Germination
   started on the 2nd day in the majority of cases. Best results were
   obtained at light and without seed dormancy break treatment, with
   significant differences between both photoperiod and pre-treatment
   modalities.

   in light and temperature controlled incubations at 15 degrees C, 20
   degrees C, 25 degrees C, 30 degrees C and at the alternate regimes of
   15/25 degrees C and 20/30 degrees C at total darkness and at 12h

   obtained at 20 degrees C at 12-h daily photoperiod. The remnant
   modalities had low germination rates (<3%). M. officinalis best
   germination rate (95%) was obtained with seeds submitted to 15-days
   chilled incubated at the alternate regime of 15/25 degrees C at 12-h
   photoperiod modality. High statistical differences were obtained for
   temperature and photoperiod on both species. A. eupatoria plants
   increased 30-fold their dry biomass in the final 3 months of the
   survival trial. The root part had a higher increase. All 5.5 cm A.
   eupatoria root cuttings successfully developed stems and/or roots at 15

AB The goal of this work was to determine the best method of breaking the
   achene dormancy in Potamogeton praelongus Wulfen. The ways of breaking
   achene dormancy studied in this experiment included methods of achene
   storage, stratification, UVA radiation, anaerobic conditions, mechanical
   disruption of achenes?outer layers and their chemical disruption by
   NaClO. Nine different treatments of achenes were combined with two
   methods of achene storage. Particular achene treatments and storage
   conditions were proven to have a significant impact on breaking
   dormancy. Although the highest germination rate (83.3%) was achieved
   when the dormancy was broken chemically by long effect of 100%
   concentrations of Savo detergent (containing 5% NaClO), the growth of
   the sprouts was subsequently inhibited due to toxic effects of Savo.
   Thus the most successful treatment was based on changing temperature,
   e.g. 2.5 months of cold storage followed by 14 days at room temperature
   (germination rate 32.7%). This treatment was also most similar to the
   natural process. Germinated achenes were also found in Petri dishes
   exposed to UVA radiation, anaerobic conditions and chemical disruption
   of the outer layers. Results of these treatments were influenced by the
   storage method.

AB The temperature requirements for seed germination and nutritional
   requirements for embryo growth were investigated in seed populations of
   Arum maculatum L. plants growing in South-east England. Seeds freshly
   harvested from orange-red berries were shown to require a protracted
   period of chilling at about 6-degrees-C for germination to occur in
   either the light (1 2 h photoperiod) or the dark. There was no obligate
   requirement for chilled seeds to be transferred to higher temperatures
   for germination to occur, although such treatment did facilitate
   germination. Germination rate at cold temperature varied over three
   consecutive harvest years with faster germination rates apparently
   related to warmer temperature during seed development on the parent
   plant. This positive effect of warm temperature pretreatment on cold
   temperature germination rate was also evident in harvested seeds.
   Depending on the initial level of seed dormancy, the effect could be
   saturated after only a few weeks at 25-degrees-C. The observation that
   similar germination rates occurred in seed which had been incubated in
   the light or dark for up to 1 yr at 11-28-degrees-C indicated that such
   treatments neither altered seed viability nor induced secondary
   dormancy. Whereas extensive periods of time at low temperatures are a
   prerequisite for seed germination, isolated embryos were capable of
   development in vitro without chilling, even on a minimal medium of KNO3
   and sucrose only, but not on water or KNO3 alone. In vitro seedling
   development progressed optimally through tuber formation to first leaf
   production within 9 months. It is concluded that the seed dormancy
   mechanism in this spring geophyte serves to facilitate germination after
   the winter. Furthermore, the ability to retain viability in the hydrated
   state suggests that seeds which remain dormant after the first winter
   are physiologically capable of surviving the first summer and
   germinating after the second winter.

AB Aim: The objective was formulated to screen the extracts of medicinal
   plants for tapping the antimicrobial activity against Collectotrichum
   capsici. Further, the work was planned to characterize and identify the
   nature of antimicrobial compounds and their functional groups.
   Methodology: Extracts of eleven medicinal plants were tested against the
   mycelial growth and spore germination of C. capsici under in-vitro
   conditions. Based on these results, the potential plant extracts of A.
   vasica and A. paniculata found effective against C. capsici were assayed
   for the presence of antimicrobial metabolites through TLC, GC-MS and
   FTIR analysis.
   Results: Among the medicinal plants screened, the crude extracts from
   Adathoda vasica and Andrographis paniculata inhibited mycelial growth
   and spore germination of C. capsici by 53.33% and 38.14%, respectively,
   under in-vitro conditions. GC-MS analysis of ethyl acetate extracts of
   A. vasica indicated antimicrobial compound,
   1H-Pyrrolo[2,1-b]quinazolin-9-one,3-hydroxy-2,3-dihydro- and A.
   paniculata showed the presence of two compounds, docosahexaenoic acid
   and oleic acid. Similarly, FTIR analysis revealed esters, alcohols, and
   halide groups, which are known antimicrobials.
   Interpretation: The medicinal plants, A. paniculata and A. vasica
   possessed antimicrobial metabolites, which was responsible for
   inhibiting the mycelial growth and spore germination of C. capsici.

AB Service tree (Sorbus domestica L.) is a significant species with regard
   to the biodiversity of specific habitats. Its reproduction in natural
   conditions appears to be problematic and in the interest of preserving
   the countryside, forests and their biodiversity, it is necessary to
   apply controlled reproduction procedures. Therefore, when applying such
   procedures it is of crucial importance to optimize the storage and use
   of seed material. The objective of the present article is to evaluate
   the germination rates of seeds which were stored in the long term. 95%
   of the seeds preserved at low temperatures above zero in a normal
   refrigerator for 8 years germinated after stratification in wet sand.
   The germination rate of the same seeds when moistened without
   stratification was 0%. However, after removal of the seed coat, 76% of
   these seeds germinated without stratification. Storage of air-dried
   seeds in the cold (at temperatures above zero) is ideal and is better
   than freezing them to -20 degrees C, as reported in the literature. Wet
   peat is completely unsuitable for stratification.

AB Water deficit stress negatively affects wheat growth, physiology, and
   yield. In lab and hydroponic exper-iments, osmotic stress levels
   (control,-2,-4,-6 and-8 Bars) created by PEG-6000, caused a significant
   decline in germination, mean germination time, root, shoot, and
   coleoptile length in both wheat geno-types examined. Germination was
   inhibited more in Wafaq-2001 than in Chakwal-50. Wafaq-2001 showed a
   higher susceptibility index based on root and shoot dry weight than did
   Chakwal-50. Wheat plants exhibited osmotic adjustment through the
   accumulation of proline, soluble sugars, soluble pro-teins, and free
   amino acids, and increased antioxidation activities of superoxide
   dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, and malondialdehyde. Increasing water
   deficit stress caused a linear decline in chlorophyll con-tents, leaf
   membrane stability, and relative water content in all wheat plants, with
   Wafaq-2001 showing a more severe negative impact on these parameters
   with increasing stress levels. The results suggest the possibility of
   utilizing some of these parameters as quantitative indicators of water
   stress tolerance in plants. Gas exchange measurements (photosynthesis,
   transpiration, stomatal conductance), leaf osmotic potential, water
   potential, and yield attributes decreased more abruptly with increasing
   water deficit, whereas leaf cuticular wax content increased in both
   genotypes, with more severe impacts on Wagaq-2001. More reduction in
   biochemical, physiological, and yield attributes was observed in
   Wafaq-2001 than was observed in Chakwal-50. Based on these results, we
   can conclude that Chakwal-50 is a more drought-tolerant genotype, and
   has excellent potential for future use in breeding programs to improve
   wheat drought tolerance. (c) 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier

AB Because of its exceptional salinity tolerance, inland saltgrass
   [Distichlis spicata var. stricta (L.) Greene] has great potential for
   use as a turfgrass and revegetation species of saline sites. However,
   saltgrass seeds have a low germination rate due to seed dormancy. Three
   experiments were conducted to evaluate different seed treatments to
   enhance germination and establishment of inland saltgrass. In Experiment
   I, seven different seed treatments were tested for their ability to
   enhance germination percentage in the growth chamber and compared with a
   control of no treatment. These treatments included treatments with hot
   water, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), potassium
   nitrate (KNO3), bleach, machine scarification, stratification, and hand
   nicking. Results indicated that germination percentage was increased
   only by stratification, hand nicking, and machine scarification
   treatments as compared with the control. In Experiment Il, machine
   scarification, stratification, hand nicking, and the control were tested
   in the growth chamber. Hand nicking, scarification, and stratification
   increased percentage germination from 13.0% to 54.0 to 61.7%.
   Stratification resulted in the fastest germination, followed by hand
   nicking and scarification. Experiment III was conducted in the field,
   and seed treatments included machine scarification, stratification, and
   the control. Two months after seeding, plots seeded with stratified and
   scarified saltgrass seeds established adequate plot coverage as a turf,
   whereas the coverage for the control was inadequate, exhibiting inferior
   turf quality. In summary, stratification and machine scarification
   improve germination and establishment of seeded saltgrass.

AB Objective: The chilling requirement of different walnut varieties city
   was studied, it provided a reference for developing walnut industry in
   karst areas in southern China. Method: The sixteen major walnut
   varieties in Hechi, Gangxi were materials. Seven levels of chilling
   requirement were set(4 °C treatment for 400,500,600,700,800,900 and 1000
   h), mixed buds and male buds of each variety were inserted into a bottle
   filled with clear water about 2 cm high and placed in a tissue culture
   chamber for 15 d, then the growth and growth amount of mixed bud and
   male flower of each walnut variety were calculated, in order to select
   suitable walnut varieties for promotion in karst areas. Result: Among
   the 16 walnut varieties, Zhangqinghua had the lowest chilling
   requirement of 600 h;followed by Yunguang pecan whose chilling
   requirement was 700 h;the chilling requirement of Santai walnut,
   Xiangling, Dapao, Fengyou No.1, Lufengchun, Liaonghe No.4 and
   Zhangmingwei was at medium(800 h);the chilling requirement of Niangqing
   and Jinlongbofeng was 900 h;the chilling requirement of other varieties
   such as Yunxin, Zhonglin No.1, Yuanlin, American pecan and Rili all
   exceeded 1000 h. This study also showed that the male flower of the same
   variety of walnut required more chilling requirement than mixed buds,
   only Xiangling and Lufengchun had 50.0% germination rate of male flowers
   after 900 h treatment, and the other varieties had less than 50.0%
   germination rate of male flowers after 1000 h treatment. In the growth
   of buds after germination, Santai walnut, Yunxin and Yunguang pecan
   showed good growth in bud after germination, Zhonglin No.1 and Yuanlin
   showed poor growth after germination. In the total length of bud growth,
   Santai walnut, Yunxin, Xiangling, Yunguang pecan, Lufengchun, Liaohe
   No.4, Zhangmingwei and Jinlongbofeng all reached or exceeded 5.00 cm
   under 1000 h. Except for Lufengchun, the total amount of bud growth of
   other seven varieties under 1000h was significantly different from other
   treatments(P < 0.05);Zhonglin No.1 and Yuanlin were only 0.50 cm under
   1000 h, the differences of Zhonglin No.1 among treatments were not
   significant(P > 0.05). Conclusion: In the introduction of walnut
   varieties in Hechi, the varieties with low chilling requirement and good
   growth after germination and stronger adaptability should be chosen.
   Santai walnut and Yunguang pecan are suitable for the promotion of
   planting in karst areas in Guangxi.

   treatment of the seeds with vermiculite the germination rate,
   germination energy, germination index and vigor index of seeds and the
   fresh and dry weights of seedlings were significantly higher than those
   of control. The priming treatment with vermiculite significantly
   improved the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase
   (POD) in the leaves of seedlings and significantly decreased the rate of
   producing superoxide anion (O2-.) and the content of malondialdehyde
   (MDA), resulting in lower membrane lipid peroxidation and significantly
   higher contents of free proline, soluble protein and soluble sugar in
   the seedlings. The above results indicated that priming treatment with

   rooting was 400-450 mg/L, whereas it was 300-350 mg/L for the secondary
   provenance seeds. (2) Interaction of root length, GA3 concentration and
   chilling treatment had a significant effect on the start sprouting time,
   germination energy and germination rate, while GA3 and chilling
   treatment promoted germination more effectively on rooted seeds with
   more than 4 cm long roots. (3) The optimum treatment combination for
   seed germination ranged from provenances, chilling for 20 days combined
   with 300 mg/L GA3, chilling for 20 days combined with 200 mg/L GA3 and
   chilling for 40 days with 300 mg/L GA3 were the best for Hubei, Henan

   rate using sulfuric acid treatment after 5d was 79.83%, higher than that
   of the control (74.66%). It was suggested that the seed shell was not
   the main factor for dormancy. Sulfuric acid soaking for 90 min and lower
   temperature stratification could promote seed germination in advance,
   and increase germination rate, with a germination rate at 68%,
   significantly, higher than other treatments. The inhibitory effects of
   extracts on cabbage seed germination was in the order: seed

AB Acer tataricum ssp. ginnala is the maple from eastern Asia.
   Accessibility of this taxon on the trade depends on knowledge of
   cultivation technologies. Proper preseeding treatment is an important
   part of propagation by seeds of this taxon and is the specific object of
   studies of specialists and professional growers. It mostly depends on
   the character of seed dormancy, which has not been determined up till
   now. The aim of the present work was to characterize seed dormancy of
   Acer tataricum ssp. ginnala. An experiment was conducted to cultivate
   seeds treated in different ways before seeding. The results were
   compared with the germination rate of the seeds sown in the same
   conditions with no preseeding treatment. The other experiment was
   focused on cultivation of tested taxa in defined conditions using cold
   stratification in combination with seed coat removal as a preseeding
   treatment. The results analysis showed that seed coats were particularly
   responsible for dormancy of tested taxon.

AB Rowan is a tree with a very limited distribution in the upper treeline
   in the Hyrcanian forest. In this study, seven habitats of this tree from
   east to west of the Hyrcanian forest were identified and seed
   germination behaviors and diversity in leaf morphological traits were
   evaluated. Multivariate analysis showed that the studied populations
   were not differentiated from each other in terms of morphological
   traits. The results of germination percentage showed that in cold
   treatment and hot and cold treatment, germination reached about 100%
   after about 70 weeks. The germination rate in the cold treatment reaches
   its peak at week 55 and about 90% of the seeds germinate at week 55. In
   the hot and cold combination treatment, although before week 50 the
   germination rate reaches its maximum with a cumulative germination
   percentage of about 40%, but from this week to week 55 the germination
   rate again slows down and from week 55 to week 60 second drops. It
   experiences its peak with about 80% germination. The results of the
   present study showed that the Rowan tree species does not have a high
   morphological diversity in its habitats in the northern Iran. Due to
   lack of knowledge on the long-term seed germination of this tree,
   mountain nurseries have been unsuccessful in producing seedling.

AB Aconitum chasmanthum Stapf ex Holmes, a highly valued medicinal plant,
   is a critically endangered plant species with restricted global
   distribution. Because there is no published report on the in vitro
   micropropagation of A. chasmanthum, the present study was undertaken to
   contribute to the development of an efficient micropropagation protocol
   for its conservation. Seeds collected from the wild showed enhanced
   germination after being given a chilling treatment (-4 degrees C and -20
   degrees C) for different durations (10, 20, 30 and 40 days). Seeds given
   a chilling treatment of -4 degrees C for 10 days showed enhanced
   germination rates of 47.59 +/- 0.53% with a mean germination time of
   10.78 +/- 0.21 days compared to seeds kept at room temperature when
   grown in an MS basal medium. Nodes, leaves and stems, taken from
   20-40-day-old seedlings, were used as an explant for micropropagation.
   An MS medium supplemented with different concentrations of cytokinins
   (BAP, Kn), auxins (2,4-D, NAA), and an additive adenine sulphate were
   tested for callusing, direct shoot regeneration and rooting. Only nodal
   explants responded and showed direct multiple shoot regeneration with 7
   +/- 0.36 shoots with an elongation of 5.51 +/- 0.26 cm in the MS medium
   supplemented with BAP 0.5 mg/L, and with a response time (RT) of 10.41
   +/- 0.51 days and a percentage culture response of 77.77 +/- 2.77%.
   Rhizome formation was observed after 8 weeks, with the highest culture
   response of 36.66 +/- 3.33% in the MS basal media with an RT of 43.75
   +/- 0.50 days. These rhizomes showed a 60% germination rate within 2
   weeks and developed into plantlets. The present in vitro regeneration
   protocol could be used for the large-scale propagation and conservation
   of A. chasmanthum.

AB The aim of this study was to examine whether Ferula gummosa seeds
   possess physical, physiological or combined dormancy. Seeds collected
   from Shahrekord zone in the center of Iran were subjected to different
   treatments. Dormancy breaking treatments were included: prechilling for
   20, 30 and 40 days, exogenous application of GA, (250, 500 and 1000
   ppm), prechilling for 40 days combined with various levels of GA(3)
   (250,500, 1000 ppm), H2SO4 (80%) for 5 and 10 min, hot water at
   different temperatures (70 and 90 degrees C) for 10 min, thiourea (3%)
   and KNO3 (0.3%) for 72 h. Germination of Ferula gummosa significantly
   increased at higher concentrations of GA, (1000 ppm) and a longer period
   of prechilling treatments (for 40 days) and reached 41 and 69%,
   respectively. Consequently, these treatments were highly effective in
   dormancy breaking in comparison with other prechilling and GA3
   treatments. The highest germination was observed when seeds were exposed
   to prechilling (for 40 days) combined with GA, (1000 ppm) and induced up
   to 75% germination and suggested a synergistic response to GA, and
   prechilling. Radicle and plumule length, vigor index and Mean
   Germination Time (MGT) were also affected through treatments. Thiourea
   (3%), KNO3 (0.3%) and 90 degrees C hot water for 10 min had no effect on
   germination and other traits. Germination rate was positively correlated
   with germination percentage. These results showed that Ferula gummosa
   seeds exhibit both exogenous and endogenous dormancy.

   (76%) and germination rate (27.8 seedling/ day) obtained in interaction
   of potassium nitrate (0.2%), temperature (8°C) and stratification (60

AB Ferula assa-foetida is an Iranian endemic medicinal plant that belongs
   to Apiaceae family. Seeds of this plant have a long period of dormancy.
   Therefore, experimental methods, which decrease seed dormancy period,
   could be effective in the seed germination rate and also in revival of
   the plant. The effect of GA3 as a pre-treatment (at high concentrations
   in a short time period at 232°C) and treatment (low concentrations in a
   long time period at 232 and 4°C) on germination of two Tabas and
   Shirkooh population seeds on MS medium was analyzed. Comparative
   analyses on treated and pre-treated seeds from two populations with GA3
   at 232°C temperature did not show any significant changes in both the
   germination percentage and rate. However, seeds chilling treatment (4°C)
   indicated increased germination rate and percentage. So, after 12 weeks
   the maximum germination percentages were 84 and 56% for Tabas and
   Shirkooh populations. Also the effect of the temperature was
   investigated on seed germination on the wet filter paper in two levels
   of 232 and 4°C. According to results, maximum seed germination
   percentage obtained for Shirkooh were (90%) and Tabas (67%) populations
   by soaking the seeds on the wet filter papers in Petri dishes within 8
   to 9 weeks. Finally, it seems that increasing endogenous GA3
   concentration, which is provided mostly by chilling treatment, is the
   most effective factor for breaking the seed dormancy.

AB A highly resolved, 3D model of hydrodynamics and Alexandrium fundyense
   in an estuarine embayment has been developed to investigate the physical
   and biological controls on a recurrent harmful algal bloom. Nauset
   estuary on Cape Cod (MA, USA) consists of three salt ponds connected to
   the ocean through a shallow marsh and network of tidal channels. The
   model is evaluated using quantitative skill metrics against observations
   of physical and biological conditions during three spring blooms. The A.
   fundyense model is based on prior model applications for the nearby Gulf
   of Maine, but notable modifications were made to be consistent with the
   Nauset observations. The dominant factors controlling the A. fundyense
   bloom in Nauset were the water temperature, which regulates organism
   growth rates, and the efficient retention of cells due to bathymetric
   constraints, stratification, and cell behavior (diel vertical
   migration). Spring-neap variability in exchange altered residence times,
   but for cell retention to be substantially longer than the cell doubling
   time, it required both active vertical migration and stratification that
   inhibited mixing of cells into the surface layer by wind and tidal
   currents. Unlike in the Gulf of Maine, the model results were relatively
   insensitive to cyst distributions or germination rates. Instead, in
   Nauset, high apparent rates of vegetative cell division by retained
   populations dictated bloom development. Cyst germination occurred
   earlier in the year than in the Gulf of Maine, suggesting that Nauset
   cysts have different controls on germination timing. The model results
   were relatively insensitive to nutrient concentrations, due to eutrophic
   conditions in the highly impacted estuary or due to limitations in the
   spatial and temporal resolution of nutrient sampling. Cell loss rates
   were inferred to be extremely low during the growth phase of the bloom
   but increased rapidly during the final phase due to processes that
   remain uncertain. The validated model allows a quantitative assessment
   of the factors that contribute to the development of a recurrent harmful
   algal bloom and provides a framework for assessing similarly impacted
   coastal systems.

AB An experiment was carried out to evaluate the influences of seed storage
   temperature and variation due to cultivars on the germination of the
   Lilium*formolongi hort. seeds. The seeds of four cultivars of
   Lilium*formolongi Hort. viz. Augusta, Raizan Herald (RH), Eorayeon 1ho,
   and Eorayeon 2ho was treated with four temperature ranges 5°C, -2°C,
   -20°C and 20°C (Room temperature, Control) up to 6 months to execute the
   experiment. In total 500 seeds of each cultivar including four
   temperature regimes and four replications for each temperature treatment
   and each replication represented by 30 seeds have been provided 10 days
   chilling treatment before to test the germination to get the uniformity
   in germination. The laboratory experiment was carried out in a
   completely randomized design (CRD) to assess the different parameters of
   germination viz. germination percentage(GP), mean germination time
   (MGT), germination index (GI), time taken to 50% germination (T50), and
   coefficient of the velocity of germination (CVG) at four temperature
   regime of four cultivars. The ANOVA analysis revealed significant
   variability among the four cultivars for all germination parameters in
   all temperature treatment levels. The results of the experiment
   demonstrated that the storage temperature has a great influence on
   germination percentage (GP), mean germination time (MGT), germination
   index (GI), time taken to 50% germination (T50), and coefficient of the
   velocity of germination (CVG) with comparisons to the normal temperature
   stored seeds (20°C). The significant variation among these parameters
   for each cultivar demonstrated the significance of varied requirements
   like stored temperature for the long term storage of that particular
   cultivar.

AB Lilium polyphyllum D. Don ex Royle, a Critically Endangered medicinal
   plant of the Himalayan Region is exploited for its roots to meet the
   demand of pharmaceutical industries. Over exploitation from the natural
   habitats has caused population depletion to a great extent. Therefore,
   population status of Lilium polyphyllum, effect of soil factors and
   associated species, and methods to improve seed germination were
   investigated. Species were sampled in habitats, seeds were collected and
   subjected to various treatments viz., soaking, chilling, plant growth
   regulators (indol acetic acid, indol butyric acid and gibbrelic acid)
   and chemical compounds (potassium nitrate and sodium hypochlorite).
   Lilium polyphyllum was recorded in only two habitats between 2338 and
   2574m with density range of 1-6.7 plants m(-2). Density had significant
   correlations with soil moisture content (r = 0.463, P < 0.05) and
   nitrogen (r = -0.96, P < 0.01). In control conditions seed germination
   (35%) and Mean Germination Time (91 days) was poor. All the treatments
   applied to the seeds improved germination and MGT significantly (P <
   0.01) over control. Sodium hypochlorite (5 min) improved the germination
   percentage to 92% and indol acetic acid (100 mu M) reduced mean
   germination time to 20 days. Species had high sensitivity to soil
   factors (i.e., nitrogen and moisture), non-native species and habitat
   destruction in natural habitats. Therefore, regular monitoring of its
   habitats, mass multiplication using germination protocol and
   transplantation are suggested to conserve the species. (C) 2010 Elsevier

AB Solanum torvum is a highly vigorous relative of eggplant that is
   resistant to a number of harmful soil-borne diseases and is compatible
   for grafting with eggplant. Being a potential rootstock, this plant
   frequently presents poor and erratic germination, which makes its
   practical use difficult. We used an L8 (2(7)) orthogonal array design to
   evaluate the primary effects of seven factors (soaking of seeds,
   scarification with sodium hypochlorite (NaClO), application of
   gibberellic acid (GA(3)), use of potassium mitrate (KNO3) as a
   moistening agent, cold stratification, application of a heatshock, and
   light irradiation during germination) at two levels (L0 and L1) using
   four germination parameters (early and final germination, germination
   rate and vigour index) in fresh S. torvum seeds. S. torvum seeds had a
   strong dormancy with no germination in the untreated seeds and high
   early and final germination (approximately 100%) in certain treatments.
   An evaluation of the main effects revealed highly positive effects on
   germination from seed soaking, and the use of GA(3), KNO3, and light
   irradiation, whereas NaClO scarification had a negative effect. The
   application of cold stratification and heat shock treatments also had a
   positive effect on seed germination but to a lesser extent than the
   other treatments. An improved proposed protocol that consisted of
   subjecting seeds to soaking, the application of GA(3) and KNO3, cold
   stratification, heat shock, and light irradiation was validated and
   demonstrated to be highly effective, with seed germination success
   greater than 60% being observed at 3 days and final germination reaching
   a plateau at 6 days. A second validation experiment using a commercial
   growing substrate also showed a high emergence (approximately 50%) at 7
   days and a final germination of approximately 80% was recorded with
   application of the improved protocol. The seed germination protocol that
   we have developed will facilitate the use of S. torvum as a rootstock
   for eggplant and its use in breeding programmes. Our results also reveal
   that orthogonal array designs are a powerful tool for establishing
   improved protocols for seed germination. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

AB The efficiency of conventional stratification methods for seed
   germination of walnut (Juglans regia L.), which uses long moist-chilling
   periods, is low. This experiment was conducted during winter to spring
   2014 to optimize the seed germination of walnut 'Chandler' via changing
   growing media and removing seed mechanical dormancy. Fourteen treatments
   were tested. None of the seeds germinated without any treatment on shell
   or while they stored in manure. Germination percent of cracked seeds
   (CS) and cracked with toothpicks inserted seeds (CTS) without any
   stratification period reached up to 66.1% and 83.7% with mean
   germination time (MGT) of 0.73 and 0.98 day, respectively. Considering a
   45-day cold storage period improved germination percentage of CS and CTS
   up to 88.3% and 94.1% with MGT of 1.02 and 1.12, respectively. Seedling
   growth parameters significantly increased after the cold storage period.
   Based on the results, mechanical dormancy was suggested as the main
   limiting factor for walnut seed germination. Therefore, rate and
   percentage of seed germination and seedling growth of walnut can be
   improved if the removal of mechanical dormancy is also considered in
   seed stratification.

   Spach, P. haussknechtii Bornm, P. communis L. and P. persica L. was
   studied to determine their seed germination percentages. First, mature
   seeds, without endocarp were treated with two percent TMTD
   (tetramethylthiuram disulphide) fungicide solution for 30 min, then were
   tested by hydrogen peroxide (0%, 0.5% and 1%), GA3 (250 and 500 mgl-1)
   for 24 hours and stored at 7°C for 1-10 weeks. Number of germinated
   seeds, germination percent (GP), mean germination time (MGT) and mean
   germination rate (MGR) were recorded for each species. Results showed
   significant difference between species according to their germination
   time. Prunus communis L. required the least time to break seed dormancy
   and germinated faster among tested species while P. persica L. required
   the highest period of time. Also, different concentrations of hydrogen
   peroxide and gibberellic acid had significant effect on breaking seed
   dormancy of studied species. After five weeks of stratification, seed
   germination percentages were 68% in Prunus scoparia (0.5% H2O2), 60% in
   P. communis (500 ppm GA3), 42% in P. haussknechtii (500 ppm GA3) and 34%
   in P. persica (250 ppm GA3) while control seeds failed to germinate.

AB The aim of the study was to determine the influence of different methods
   on breaking seed dormancy of weed species velvetleaf (Abutilon
   theophrasti Medik.) and redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.). The
   influence of seed sowing depth on emergence and growth of weeds was also
   evaluated. The results showed that the best treatment for breaking seed
   dormancy of velvetleaf was immersion of seeds in hot water (60°C) for 1
   hour, while immersion in distilled water and 0.2% KNO3 solution had no
   significant effect. Seed germination of redroot pigweed was
   significantly increased in all treatments, however 2% KNO3 solution and
   cold stratification at 5°C for 12 days had the greatest effect.
   Treatments had different influence on mean germination time, seed
   germination dynamics and seedling length of weeds. The highest
   percentage of emerged velvetleaf seedlings was recorded when seeds were
   sown at 1 to 4 cm depths and ranged from 55.6 to 67.9%. With the
   increase of sowing depth the emergence percentage decreased, however one
   quarter and one fifth of the seedlings emerged from 7 and 9 cm depths.
   Both seedling length and fresh weight were greater at lower sowing
   depths. Emergence of redroot pigweed was not significantly influenced by
   sowing depth, however seedlings length and fresh weight were greater at
   5 cm depth than at 1 cm.

AB Ex situ conservation of rare plant species requires an understanding of
   germination requirements. We report the first successful germination
   trials for Maguire primrose (Primula cusickiana var. maguirei [L.O.
   Williams] N.H. Holmgren & S. Kelso), a threatened perennial herb
   narrowly restricted to a 20-km canyon in northern Utah, USA. Seeds
   collected from different sites (upper or lower canyon populations) and
   flower morphs (pin or thrum) that had been stored for either 1 or 2
   years were cold, moist stratified in darkness at 1-2 degrees C for 270
   days. Independent of treatment, time to first germination was
   approximately 75 days, time to 50% germination (T-50) was approximately
   165 days, and total germination was 55.8%. Higher mean germination was
   observed in seeds stored for 2 years compared with seeds stored for 1
   year, as well as in seeds from pin flowers compared with thrum flowers.
   There was not a significant effect of site on mean germination, but
   there was a significant storage time x site interaction. Seeds stored
   for 2 years also had a lower mean T-50 versus seeds stored for 1 year.
   In addition, seeds from upper canyon populations had a higher mean T-50
   than those from lower canyon populations. Our results suggest that
   short-term storage should not significantly decrease seed viability, and
   that both flower morph and canyon location may influence germination.
   Evidence suggests that germination patterns are adaptive. Our results
   contribute to our understanding of the germination biology of P.
   cusickiana var. maguirei and inform future conservation efforts for this
   threatened species.

AB Cyperus capitatus Vandelli (Cyperaceae) is distributed in coastal sandy
   habitats and mobile dunes of south Europe. Its seed germination ecology
   is not known, despite its potential to be used in re-vegetation
   projects. Laboratory experiments were conduced to assess the effects of
   salinity, light regime, cold stratification and burial on seed
   germination of this species. Overall, increasing salinity delayed
   germination, increased seed dormancy and mean time to germination (MTG),
   and reduced final germination percentage, inhibiting it completely above
   1% of salinity: although it did not affect seed viability. C. capitatus
   seeds exhibited their greatest germination at levels between 0 and 1% in
   non-stratified seeds, and between 0 and 0.5% for stratified seeds. Thus,
   the effect of salt was greater for stratified seeds at 5 degrees C.
   Germination in light/darkness conditions was similar to that in full
   darkness. Finally, burial in sand of C. capitatus seeds appeared to have
   a significant effect on cumulative percentage of germination. Seeds
   buried at depths greater than 2 and 3 cm showed a lower germination
   success than those on sand surface or buried at shallower depths. Burial
   also affected the beginning and speed of seed germination. (C) 2010

AB In contrast to scarified seeds, unscarified seed did not germinate in
   any of the treatments, indicating that Koelreuteria paniculata Laxm.
   seeds have hard, impermeable seed coat dormancy. Exogenous application
   of 100, 200 and 300 ppm GA increased germination of scarified seeds from
   0 (control) to 17, 18 and 15%, respectively. Pre-chilling in distilled
   water (DW) for 60 days increased germination to 44%. Compared with
   DW-chilled seeds, the germination of seeds chilled in gibberellic acid
   (GA-chilled) was significantly increased after 15 days of chilling and
   maximum germination of seeds chilled in 100, 200 and 300 ppm GA was 60,
   51 and 54%, respectively, achieved after 30 days.
   Longer duration of chilling in GA appeared harmful. Germination rate was
   positively correlated with germination percentage. These results show
   that K. paniculata seeds exhibit both exogenous and endogenous dormancy.

   dormancy in a relatively short period of time. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science

AB Goldenrain-tree (Koelreuteria paniculata Laxm.) is wide spread as an
   ornamental tree but the propagation is difficult because of pronounced
   seed dormancy. Unscarified seeds of K. paniculata Laxm. failed to
   germinate after any pre-treatments. Similarly, seeds soaked or soaked
   and redried without chilling were unable to germinate. However, seeds
   that were scarified, without soaking or soaking-redrying, gave 44%
   germination after 60 days of moist chilling. The germination was
   increased to more than 50% when seeds were soaked or soaked-redried in
   DW or GA for 5 h and moist chilled for 60 days (DW) and 30 days (GA). On
   the other hand, the germination of seeds soaked for 24 h and moist
   chilled was very low, but was higher if the seeds were redried after
   soaking. Dry chilling after soaking or soaking-redrying for 24 h also
   promoted germination, and maximum germination (>50%) was achieved after
   15 days of dry chilling. In general, higher germination was associated
   with higher germination rate, i.e., faster germination, except dry
   chilled seeds that were slow to germinate despite their higher
   germination. These results clearly indicated that K. paniculata seeds
   had both exogenous and endogenous dormancy and identified some
   treatments that released the dormancy.

AB Organic dormancy, the inability to germinate under favorable conditions,
   is a common problem in many crop species and their wild relatives,
   leading to more variable emergence, plant density, and growth rates,
   thus increasing costs, and lowering yield. To overcome these problems,
   several different methods have been developed for various crop and model
   plants. However, in the emerging crop being bred from wild and
   semi-domesticated Silphium, no such method has been established thus
   far. The objective of this study was to identify a dormancy-breaking
   assay to increase the seed germination rate. Seeds of three different
   Silphium integrifolium Michx. genotypes were treated with five chemical
   and one cold treatment, and dried before or after the treatment at 27 A
   degrees C or 40 A degrees C. Untreated, dried seeds were taken as
   control. Seeds soaked for 24 h in a ethephon/potassium nitrate solution
   followed by a 72 h drying step at 40 A degrees C showed an increase of
   germination to up to 90 +/- 2% compared to control seeds (3 +/- 0% and 5
   +/- 1%). We identified the minimum time frame of cold stratification
   needed to enhance seed germination in Silphium, and found that cold
   stratification was nearly as good as the chemical treatment. Our results
   provide two alternate ways to treat S. integrifolium seeds for breaking
   organic dormancy, which will help to facilitate future research in the
   Silphium domestication community. The fact that our optimal treatments
   were similar to protocols developed for sunflower suggests that these
   methods may also be applicable to many related economically important
   Asteraceae species.

AB A greenhouse experiment was conducted to study the effects of abrasion,

   treatments on the germination of 10 Calligonum species. That are
   dominant shrubs used for restoration of desert vegetation in mobile sand
   dunes and stabilized sand fields in the northern desert of China. Little
   is known about their germination characteristics. In August-September
   1998, seeds of Calligonum were collected and were treated by five
   pre-sowing treatments before the germination experiments. The results
   show that the germination response of seeds to the different
   pretreatments was more or less similar for all 10 Calligonum species.
   The germination percent of seed from the 10 species was lowest for
   exudate treatments and highest for abrasion treatments. The abrasion,
   sulphuric acid and cold stratification treatments significantly promoted
   overall germination. Compared with the control, the exudate treatment
   significantly hampered germination, rate of germination and bolstered
   dormancy for almost all species. The cold stratification treatment can
   break the dormancy of viable Calligonum seeds and increase the
   germination, but it has lethal effect on viable seeds probably as well
   as the boiling water treatments. Almost all germination parameters
   showed significant difference between the pre-sowing treatments for all
   10 Calligonum species. The speed and percent germination of the
   Calligonum species can be greatly increased by mechanical scarification
   or acid treatments. The results show that seeds of C. junceum have good
   germination potential. These conclusions are very important because
   Calligonum species can be propagated by seed in the arid desert regions.

AB Question: In the Taibai Mountains, birch forests dominated by Betula
   albo-sinensis and Betula utilis are considered unsustainable because
   there are few seedlings or saplings in the forests. Tree-fall gaps play
   a central role in the natural regeneration of trees. In this study, seed
   germination and seedling emergence in gap and non-gap plots were
   investigated to explore the role of tree-fall gaps in the natural
   regeneration of birch forests.
   Location: Taibai Mountains, Shaanxi Province, China.
   Methods: A field survey was conducted to reveal the relationship between
   tree-fall gaps and birch seedlings. Field and laboratory experiments
   were conducted to investigate seed germination and seedling
   establishment in gap and non-gap plots.
   Results: In the field survey, occurrence of birch seedlings was
   correlated with gap size, which confirms that tree-fall gaps play a
   crucial role in the regeneration of birch forests. However, in the field
   experiment, seed germination was extremely low in both gap and non-gap
   plots, and all seedlings died within 60d in a seedling establishment
   test. The only difference between gap and non-gap plots in the field
   experiment was that more seeds survived winter in the gap plots than in
   the non-gap plots. The laboratory experiment helped us understand
   results of the field experiment. In the seed germination tests, Betula
   seeds germinated well in light treatments, but very few germinated in
   darkness, indicating that Betula seeds are photoblastic. No seeds
   germinated at 15/5 degrees C (day/night temperature regime),
   demonstrating the reason for lack of germination in the field
   experiment. The cover of forest litter reduced the seed germination
   rate. Seeds stored in dry conditions maintained high survival rates
   after long-term storage at low temperature. However, the survival of
   imbibed seeds decreased with decreasing storage temperature.
   Conclusions: Seed germination and seedling establishment of Betula
   require a dry and light environment. The main regeneration barriers to
   seed germination and seedling growth in the non-gap plots are chilling
   injury and lack of light. Tree-fall gaps are better habitats for Betula
   seed survival and seedling establishment. This indicates that
   regeneration of birch forest relies on disturbance.

AB Shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris) is a problematic weed in
   citrus orchards and crop fields in northern Iran. In a series of
   laboratory and greenhouse experiments, we evaluated the effects that
   treatment with gibberellic acid (GA(3)) and potassium nitrate (KNO3), as
   well as environmental factors, including temperature, the duration of
   pre-chilling (wet and dry), drought stress, salt stress, pH, and sowing
   depth, have on seed dormancy breaking and germination in C.
   bursa-pastoris. Treatment with GA(3) strongly stimulated germination of
   C. bursa-pastoris in conditions of light/ dark and continuous darkness.
   The germination rate was highest (40.08%) for seeds treated with 400 ppm
   of GA(3) in the light/ dark condition. Treatment with KNO3 did not
   significantly influence seed germination. Longer wet pre- chilling
   promoted germination and was more successful in seed dormancy breaking
   than was dry pre-chilling. Seed germination occurred at 10-30 degrees C
   and within a range of pH of 3-11. Drought and salt stress both strongly
   inhibited germination. Seedling emergence decreased in proportion to
   sowing depth. The rates of C. bursa-pastoris germination and seedling
   emergence were highest for seeds on the soil surface.

AB Heavenly bamboo (Nandina domestica) is a popular ornamental shrub used
   as an indoor plant and for landscaping. However, seed propagation has
   been limited due to its very slow germination (9 months under natural
   conditions) caused by an extended seed dormancy period. We used various
   temperature treatments, including simulations of seasonal temperature
   changes, to investigate the temperature requirements for dormancy
   breaking and the germination of heavenly bamboo seeds at the embryo and
   whole-seed levels. Heavenly bamboo seeds were found to have no physical
   dormancy because the seeds imbibed water readily. However, its mature
   seeds contained underdeveloped embryos (E:S ratio <0.2) that had
   morphological dormancy. The seeds did not germinate within a month of
   incubation at fluctuating temperatures of 25/15, 20/10, and 15/6, or at
   5 degrees C alone, which indicated that they had morphophysiological
   dormancy as well as morphological dormancy. A simulation study of
   seasonal temperatures (move-along test) showed that warm stratification
   (25/15 degrees C) was needed to stimulate embryo growth and germinate
   the seeds, but cold stratification (5 degrees C) was not required. Warm
   stratification at a constant 20 degrees C hastened seed germination more
   than a fluctuating temperature at 25/15 degrees C, and it led to a
   germination time that was shorter by 4 months than that under natural
   conditions. Application of gibberellic acid (GA(3)) at 100 and 1000
   mgL(-1) could substitute for warm stratification and broke dormancy in
   seeds incubated at 15/6 degrees C. These results suggested that heavenly
   bamboo seeds had non-deep simple morphophysiological dormancy, which
   could be broken by warm stratification at 25/15 or 20 degrees C. (C)

AB The germination of mature seeds of olive (Olea europaea L.) from six
   cultivars was examined by recording the percent germination, rate of
   germination and the ability to produce ethylene. The effects of various
   treatments, namely thidiazuron (TDZ), a compound with cytokinin-like
   activity, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), and
   aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVC), on these variates were also evaluated.
   The main characteristics of seed development were also defined in both
   'Moraiolo' and 'Canino', following harvest on three dates, by
   determining the course of the dehydration process and the ability of the
   seeds to produce ethylene; the effect of maturity state on germination
   and ethylene production was clarified. In general, there were wide
   variations between the cultivars with no positive correlations between
   the examined parameters. Germination of untreated seeds (control) from
   all the cultivars was always accompanied by an increase in ethylene
   synthesis. The presence of ACC was not always effective in a concomitant
   stimulation of germination and ethylene production. Instead, TDZ
   influenced the germination process in almost all the cultivars even if
   it did not always enhance ethylene production. In all cultivars tested,
   the presence of AVG in general reduced the stimulatory effect of TDZ on
   the percent germination and on ethylene production. The findings are
   discussed in relation to the possible role of ethylene production in the
   germination of olive seeds.

AB Observations on 35-yr-old and 6-yr-old plants in Italy showed that there
   were considerable variations in proportions of male and female
   inflorescences between years and parts of the crown. The high percentage
   of empty seeds (40-92%) is probably due to protandry and the
   reproductive physiology of the species, characterized by the long
   periods between pollination, fertilization and development of the
   embryo. Germination tests with seeds of the Lagonegro, Italy, provenance
   showed that in darkness, seeds required chilling for at least 30 days at
   <7°C or treatment with a 20 p.p.m. solution of gibberellin. Under 8 or
   14 h photoperiods, seeds germinated in a 3-5 p.p.m. solution of
   gibberellin. Shortest germination times after chilling were achieved at
   27°C. Seed dormancy appeared to be due to the toughness of the
   integument.

AB The only source of planting material of the cowberry (Vaccinium
   vitis-idaea L.) is its natural stock, but productivity of this species
   under natural conditions is low. The results obtained in culture
   experiments from 1977 to 1983 proved that peat is an optimal medium for
   the development of the cowberry. The addition of mineral fertilizers to
   the peat increased productivity. The investigations into the
   possibilities of vegetative propagation of the cowberry involved
   experiments carried out on different substrates with different
   physiologically active substances. The experiments of 1977 on the
   rooting of cowberry cuttings showed that the highest percentage on
   rootings in the open air was achieved in the variant where the cuttings
   were treated with 10-3 M beta-indolylacetic acid for 18 hours. A mixture
   of mineral soil and peat (1:1) was used as a substrate. The experiments
   showed that cowberry seeds stored at +4 degree C in their berries
   undergo complete stratification in 4 months and give a good germination
   rate. The highest germination of cowberry seed (84-92%) was observed on
   very acid and acid media - pH 3.5-4.5. To obtain high quality,
   productive cowberry forms, the stratified seed were irradiated with
   neutrons and gamma rays and later sown on various substrates. Seed
   irradiated with neutrons at doses of 0.5. 1.0 and 1.5 krads germinated
   in 12-18 days (germination ability 62.0-67.5%) and that irradiated with
   gamma rays at doses of 5, 10 and 15 krads on the 16th day (germination
   ability from 72 to 84%). Selection of prospective cowberry forms from
   the wild was begun in 1980, and the resulting forms were tested for ten
   years for the suitability for cultivation and stability of productivity.
   Four forms were accepted as offering prospects for further cultivation.

AB Development of rapid and efficient propagation methods for Jatropha
   curcas are highly desirable since its seed oil can be used as biofuel
   and hence of high economic value. Dormancy, decreased viability with
   age, and low germination rate are amongst the common problems associated
   with its conventional propagation through seeds. In vitro germination of
   seeds, specifically during the dormant periods by using some
   pretreatments were therefore focused to help resolve some of these
   limiting issues. Pretreatments included presoaking of seeds in water
   overnight, scarification, stratification and removal of seed coats. It
   was observed that the orientation of the seeds on the culture media also
   had an effect on its germination rate. Disinfection of naked seeds could
   not support germination so the seeds were disinfected before removing
   the seed coats. It was observed that the removal of seed coats only
   could break the dormancy of seeds to get 100% In vitro germination on
   full strength MS medium kept in the dark at 25 +/- 2 degrees C in the
   months of December to January. Such seedlings were shifted in light
   conditions (16h photoperiod) after the root emergence at the same
   temperature to support chlorophyll development. Seedlings were
   successfully acclimatized by shifting to a mixture of peat, clay and
   silt (1:1:1 v/v) in greenhouse. It is expected that the reported method
   of propagation would help to develop suitable tissues for germplasm
   preservation, large scale rapid plant propagation and may find its
   application in crop improvement and hence profitability in a broader
   sense.

   chilensis germination rate. Scarification was tested in the first assay
   and compare to a control. In the second assay, cold stratification was
   applied during 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks at 4 degrees C in darkness, plus an
   unstratified control. Seeds were germinated on Petri dish containing
   water and agar (WA), and incubated for 60 days in a controlled
   atmosphere at 25 +/- 2 degrees C using cold white fluorescent light
   tubes (50 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) light intensity), under a photoperiod of 16
   h light and 8 h of darkness. All treatments achieved higher average
   germination rates than the control. The highest germination rate was
   obtained with scarification (G(max), 92%) though the fastest growth was
   achieved with 8 weeks of stratification, reaching the lowest average
   germination time of 18 days. The results demonstrate that A. chilensis
   seeds present a moderate level of primary dormancy, both exogenous and
   endogenous.

AB This Study was initiated to investigate the differences in germination
   percentages and rates between Corylopsis coreana Uyeki and Corylopsis
   sinensis var. calvescens Rehder & E.H. Wilson following a warm
   stratification (WS) and cold stratification (CS), and to study the
   effect of different WS temperatures interacting with different durations
   of CS. Warm stratification at 10 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C,
   and 25 degrees C was given for 1 month (1 M 10 degrees C, 15 degrees C,
   20 degrees C, and 25 degrees CWS) followed by 0 M, 1 M, 2 M, and 3 M of
   CS at 5 degrees C (0 M, 1 M, 2 M, 3 M CS) and seeds were germinated in
   an air conditioned greenhouse maintained at 18.5 degrees C/18 degrees C.
   On average, less than 1% of C. coreana seeds germinated when sown
   without any WS and CS or with I M 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, and 25
   degrees C WS without CS treatment. However, 26% C. coreana seeds
   germinated after 1 M 10 degrees CWS without any CS treatment.
   Germination was not affected by WS temperatures when followed by 2 M 5 C
   CS. It is concluded that C. coreana exhibited low seed germination at 10
   degrees C and that this temperature could be considered the upper limit
   of CS for C coreana. Only 2 M CS was required for more than 90% seeds to
   germinate. However, C sinensis var. calvescens required longer than 3 M
   CS for more than 29% seeds to germinate. This clearly shows that there
   is an interspecific variation in optimum dormancy-breaking requirements.

AB Genetics: The chromosome number reported for C. dactylon varies from 2n
   = 18 to 2n = 36 with diploid and polyploid populations (Cook et al.,
   2005). Ramakrishan and Singh (1966) and Sarandon (1991) have found
   differences in total biomass and biomass partition according to the
   origin of the population. Sarandon (1991) points out that characters are
   highly heritable, which means that high genetic variability for biomass
   production and variable architecture allows an ample base for selection,
   which in most cases is induced by herbicides, mechanical control or
   forage production. Reproductive Biology: C. dactylon is wind-pollinated
   and generally self-incompatible, suffering from inbreeding depression
   when genotypes are self-pollinated. Quantitative traits such as seed
   yield and forage yield can be dramatically negatively affected by
   inbreeding depression (Cook et al., 2005). In diploid populations,
   caryopses are formed after zygote formation. In polyploids, which are
   sterile, caryopses may be apomictic. Physiology: This C4 plant
   (Kissmann, 1991) has high rates of accumulation under adequate
   irradiance, water and nutrient supply and may consume 75 kg of N, 20 kg
   of P and more than 1,500,000 litres of water for 5000 kg/ha of biomass
   dry matter (Fernandez, 1991). In the south of Santa Fe province,
   Argentina, a maximum biomass of 8000 kg/ha may be generated under a
   summer crop of maize or sunflower with >75% located in the first 10 cm
   of the soil profile (Lombardo, 1973), whereas in Balcarce (Argentina)
   about 5000 kg/ha is commonly found in maize or sunflower stubble.
   Phenology: A photoperiod of 13 hours induces flowering. Low night
   temperatures coupled with high diurnal temperatures induces blooming
   (Nir and Koller, 1976). A reduction in irradiance drastically decreases
   inflorescence production (Moreira, 1975). In North America, annual
   plants reproduce during spring and perennial plants reproduce all year
   long (USDA-NRCS, 2014). Longevity: C. dactylon grows as both an annual
   and perennial grass. The annual growth-form becomes dormant and turns
   brown when nighttime temperatures fall below freezing or average daytime
   temperatures are below 10°C (Cook et al., 2005). Activity Patterns:
   Seeds may be the route of invasion in weed-free fields through the
   faeces of cows (Rodriguez, personal communication). Rhizome biomass
   exhibits an annual cyclic pattern and, as with any perennial weed, low
   temperatures reduce biomass and viability is lost as a consequence of
   the consumption of materials due to respiration and maintenance. The
   digestibility of stocked material is severely decreased, implying a loss
   in forage quality (Vaz Martins, 1989). This is a character that has
   largely improved in cultivated varieties. Each node has a physiological
   self-governing structure in relation to the apex, but is highly
   dependent on substances from other plant parts. The mother plant
   determines the runner growth pattern on the soil surface according to
   the sugar-gibberellin balance (Montaldi 1970). Node disconnection may be
   caused by natural decay and cultivation and produces damage in the
   breakdown zone and changes in hormone and nutrient relationships. It is
   widely demonstrated that rhizome or runner fragmentation induces the
   activation of buds. The proportion of activated buds increases as the
   number of buds per segment decreases (Moreira, 1980; Kigel and Koller,
   1985; Fernandez and Bedmar, 1992). The cultivation method is mainly
   responsible for vegetative propagation fragmentation. The higher the
   cultivation intensity, the smaller the segments produced (Kigel and
   Koller, 1985). Population Size and Structure This weed produces an
   enormous number of small seeds (0.25-0.30 mg), the viability and
   dormancy of which are highly variable according to genotype and the
   conditions when formed. The seed is important because it confers high
   genetic variability on the population. Perez et al. (1995) recorded a
   very low germination rate. Uygur et al. (1985) obtained up to 15%
   germination at constant temperatures of 35-40°C, and 50% at temperatures
   alternating between 20 and 30°C. Moreira (1975) obtained up to 80%
   germination with the help of nitrate, chilling and alternating
   temperatures, and Elias (1986) recorded up to 96% germination from
   heavier samples of seed. Seeds remain viable in the soil for at least 2
   years (Caixinhas et al., 1988). As a rule, cultivars have relatively
   high viability. Osmo-conditioning of Bermuda grass seeds with PEG
   followed by immediate sowing improved seed germination and seedling
   growth under saline conditions (Al-Humaid 2002). The probability of
   emergence and successful establishment of C. dactylon decreases with the
   depth of the fragment, but increases with the weight of the node and
   internode (Perez et al., 1998). Growth from plants originated from a
   runner may exhibit a different biomass partition than that from plants
   originated from a rhizome (Fernandez, 1986). From sprouting onwards,
   weed growth is controlled mainly by temperature (optimum 25-30°C) and
   radiation, but also by humidity and soil fertility. The efficiency of
   carbohydrate reserve usage during sprout growth is highly dependent on
   temperature and the type of vegetative structure; it is maximum at 20°C
   and is higher for rhizomes than for stolons (Satorre et al., 1996).
   Runners and rhizome growth begins 30 days after growth but only if soil
   temperature is >15°C. Rates of 15 g/g/day have been recorded in
   Argentina (Lescano de Rios, 1982).

AB Organic production of one of the most popular botanical supplements,
   Echinacea, continues to expand in the U.S. Echinacea seeds typically
   show a high degree of dormancy that can be broken by ethephon or
   gibberellic acid (GA), but these methods are currently disallowed in
   organic production. In order to determine the efficacy of nonchemical
   seed treatments, we evaluated the effect of varying seed source and
   supplying light, with and without cold-moist stratification, on seed
   germination of the three most important medicinal species of Echinacea,
   E. angustifolia DC, E. purpurea (L) Moench, and E. pallida (Nutt.) Nutt.
   Treatments included cold-moist stratification under 24 hours of light,
   24 hours of dark, and 16/8 hours of light/dark to break seed dormancy.
   We found that germination was greater in the E. purpurea and E. pallida
   seeds from a commercial organic seed source compared to a public
   germplasm source. When seeds were not cold-moist stratified, 16 to 24
   hours light increased germination in E. angustifolia only. Echinacea
   angustifolia, E. purpurea, and E. pallida seeds that were cold-moist
   stratified under 16 to 24 hours of light for 4 weeks had a significantly
   greater percentage and rate of germination compared to seeds germinated
   in the dark. Therefore, cold-moist stratification under light conditions
   is recommended as a method to break seed dormancy and increase
   germination rates in organic production of Echinacea.

   Buenos Aires Province, Argentina. A four factor completely randomized
   design with four replications was applied. Treatments combined original
   sites, pre chilled at 7°C for 72 h (present or absent), substrate
   moistened with 0.2% solution of potassium nitrate (KNO3) (present or
   absent) and three levels of alternating germination temperatures: 15-10,
   20-10 or 20-15°C in 8/16 h light/dark periods. The germination value
   recorded was percentage of germination of normal seedlings; Afterwards,
   the germination rate and uniformity were calculated. ANOVA, Tukey tests
   and correlations were performed. The five origins had a similar
   performance (93% of the total germination) when the temperature
   alternating of germination was 20-10 and 20-15°C in 8/16 h light/dark
   periods with KNO3 and 20-10°C pre chilled. The KNO3 solution positively
   enhanced the germination response. Higher germination rates were
   obtained with 20-15°C pre chilled+KNO3 as well as with 20-15°C KNO3. Pre
   chilled effect was related to germination temperature. When the total
   germination, rate and synchronization were considered, 20-15°C with KNO3
   was stated as optimal germination condition of Glyceria multiflora for
   all sites of collection.

AB Introduction: Seed dormancy, as a technique to avoid environmental
   stress, is important in preserving plant species and could be of various
   types including physiological, physical, morphological and
   morph-physiological dormancy. Seed testa hardness is one of the main
   causes of dormancy in leguminous family plants. A common method for
   breaking seed dormancy in leguminous plants is the use of scarification
   treatments. Given that oxygen deficiency is a factor that induces
   dormancy, scarification treatments through acceleration of gas
   exchanges, especially oxygen and carbon dioxide, can reduce seed
   dormancy and finally increase germination percentages. In addition,
   priming with gibberellic acid can help dormancy breaking in plant
   species that have physiological dormancy, finally leading to
   germination. Therefore, the present study investigated seed dormancy and
   germination to find the most appropriate treatment for the elimination
   of seed dormancy in three ecotypes of Astragalus cyclophyllus. Materials
   and Methods: A factorial experiment based on a completely randomized
   design with three replications was carried out at Agriculture Laboratory
   of Lorestan University in 2013. The first factor was three ecotypes of
   Astragalus Semirom, Damavand and Zanjan, and the second factor was seed
   dormancy breaking treatments. The applied treatments were: control,
   (mechanical scarification plus chilling time with 10, 20 and 30 days
   prechilling at 4°C), mechanical scarification + gibberellic acid at
   concentrations of 400 and 500 ppm for 48 hours, scarification with
   sulfuric acid 96% for 2 and 4 min, mechanical scarification and 2%
   potassium nitrate for 72 h, mechanical scarification and gibberellic
   acid 400 ppm for 48 h and 20 days prechilling. The measured indices
   included germination percentage, mean germination time, seedling length,
   seedling fresh weight, seedling dry weight and alpha-amylase activity.
   Results: The results showed that the interactions between seed dormancy
   breaking treatments and ecotype were significant for all the traits.
   Based on the results of mean comparison, Damavand ecotype exhibited
   better performance in terms of most of the traits studied, as compared
   with Semirom and Zanjan ecotypes. Compared with the treatments applied,
   mechanical scarification plus gibberellic acid 400 ppm was more
   effective in germination parameters and seedling vigor index. Mechanical
   scarification and gibberellic acid 400 ppm for 48 h along with 20 days
   prechilling increased total germination percentage by an average of
   67.68% in Semirom ecotype and was more effective in increasing the
   activity of alpha-amylase enzyme. Conclusion: It seems that seed
   dormancy of Astragalus cyclophyllus is not of physiological type and
   increased germination can be due to mechanical scarification in physical
   dormancy breaking and priming effect of prechilling and gibberellic
   acid.

AB To study the problems of the Astragalus seed germination, a factorial
   experiment includes ecotype and dormancy breaking was carried out in
   base of a completely randomized design with 3 replications. The first
   factor consisted of different ecotypes Samirom, Damavand, Zanjan and the
   second factor was seed dormancy breaking treatments in 10 levels
   (mechanical scarification plus chilling time with 10, 20 and 30 days
   prechilling at 4°C), mechanical scarification and gibberellic acid at a
   concentration of 400 and 500 ppm for 48 hours, scarification with
   sulfuric acid 96% for 2 and 4 min, mechanical scarification and 2%
   potassium nitrate for 72 h, mechanical scarification and gibberellic
   acid 400 ppm for 48 h with 20 days prechilling and intact seeds as
   control. Results showed that the ecotypes were different significantly
   for all traits except root length. Interaction of seed dormancy breaking
   treatments and ecotype were significant for all traits. Damavand ecotype
   was higher than the rest due to the high viability, total germination
   percentage, germination rate and seedling vigor index. Among the
   treatments, mechanical scarification+gibberellic acid 400 ppm had more
   effective for germination parameters. Based on the results it could be
   said that seed dormancy is physical, because of seed scarification
   treatments they were able to absorb water and germinate.

   All of germination traits of Black cumin increased at all concentration
   of GA3, but 1250 ppm was better than the others. Same as GA3, KNO3
   treatment had a positive effect on seed germination in all levels
   especially at 0.3% v/v. the effect of GA3 and KNO3 were not higher than
   stratification in 3 weeks. It was concluded that stratification in 3
   weeks was more effective treatment on studied traits than 1 and 2 weeks
   and it was a stronger action on breaking dormancy and germination of
   Black cumin seeds than GA3 and KNO3.

   stratification period of 7 weeks, but treatments for 1, 3 and 5 weeks
   had no strong effect on dormancy release. Mean germination time was also
   significantly enhanced by treating seeds with the mentioned treatments
   compared with the untreated seeds and other treatments. In contrast to
   stratification, seeds showed no response to applications of sulfuric
   acid 98% (v/v). Both germination traits of water lily tulip (rate and
   percentage) increased with a higher concentration of GA3 (500 ppm), but
   this effect was not higher than that of stratification for 7 weeks. KNO3
   treatment had a detrimental effect on seed germination at all levels. It
   was concluded that stratification for a 7 week period was the more
   effective treatment on the studied traits than stratification for
   periods of 1, 3 and 5 weeks and it had a stronger action on breaking the
   dormancy and inducing germination of water lily seeds than treatments of

   in Ferula gummosa Boiss (Apiaceae) seed. An experiment was conducted
   with four replications and three treatments including: 3 different
   stratification periods (0, 4 and 7 weeks), varying concentrations of GA3
   (0, 500 and 1000ppm) and 4 levels of KNO3 (0, 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3% v/v).
   Germination percentage and mean germination time were significantly
   enhanced by treating seeds with mentioned treatments compared with the
   untreated seeds. It was concluded that stratification for 7 weeks was
   more effective treatment on studied traits than 4 weeks and seed
   treatment with 1000ppm GA3 was better than 500ppm but KNO3 had no
   effect. Moreover, cold stratification was a better treatment on breaking
   seed dormancy of Galbanum seeds than GA3 and KNO3 treatments. Applying
   1000ppm concentration of GA3 and 0.3% of KNO3 after stratification
   resulted in higher germination in Galbanum dormant seeds.

   seconds with sandpaper) were subjected to different treatments
   including: GA3 (250, 500 and 750 ppm), KNO3 (0.1, 0.2 and 0.3% w/v),
   cold stratification (2, 4 and 6 days), sulfuric acid (25, 50 and 75
   seconds), hot water (90 degrees C; for 2.5 and 5 minutes), hydropriming
   via seed soaking in distilled water (4 and 8 hours) and mechanical
   scarification. Among the mentioned treatments, cold stratification for 6
   days had a best effect on germination related parameters final
   germination percentage, mean germination time and vigour indexthan the
   other periods. In contrast to scarification with acid and hot water,
   mechanical scarification improved germination parameters but this effect
   was lower than the cold stratification. The results suggest that bitter
   vetch seed has both physical and physiological dormancy.

AB PREMISE OF THE STUDY: The timing of major phenological transitions is
   critical to lifetime fitness, and life history theory predicts
   differences for annual and perennial plants. To correctly time these
   transitions, many plants rely on environmental cues such as exposure to
   extended periods of cold, which may occur at different stages throughout
   their lifetime.
   METHODS: We studied the role of cold at different life stages, by
   jointly exposing seed (stratification) and rosettes (vernalization) to
   cold. We used 23 populations of Mimulus guttatus, which vary from
   annuals to perennials, and investigated how cold at one or both stages
   affected germination, flowering, growth, and biomass.
   KEY RESULTS: We found that stratification and vernalization interact to
   affect life cycle transitions, and that cold at either stage could
   synchronize flowering phenology. For perennials, either stratification
   or vernalization is necessary for maximum flowering. We also found that
   germination timing covaried with later traits. Moreover, plants from
   environments with dissimilar climates displayed different phenological
   responses to stratification or vernalization.
   CONCLUSIONS: In general, cold is more important for seed germination in
   annuals and plants from environments with warm temperatures and variable
   precipitation. In contrast, cold is more important for flowering in
   perennials: it accelerates flowering in plants from lower precipitation
   environments, and it increases flowering proportion in plants from
   cooler, more stable precipitation environments. We discuss our findings
   in the context of the variable environments plants experience within a
   population and the variation encountered across the biogeographic native
   range of the species.

AB Late flowering to reduce the risk of late frosts is one of the main
   objectives of almond breeding programs. Breeders have to wait at least
   three years, however, to know the flowering time of newly obtained
   seedlings. Although some trials have been conducted correlating the
   chilling requirements for seed germination with leafing and flowering
   times, the results have not shown high correlations between these
   characteristics. In this work we studied the correlation between
   germination, leafing and flowering in four families created in 2009
   between very early and very late progenitors with a broad phenotypic
   segregation for flowering time. In winter, the seeds obtained were
   stratified without shells for germination. Once a week notes of
   germination date were taken. The plants obtained were taken to the
   greenhouse in pots, where they were left to grow up until the summer.
   The plants were then moved to a cold room, where the number of buds
   sprouted was noted on a weekly basis as the leafing time in controlled
   conditions. Finally, the plants were taken to the definitive plots, and
   the leafing and flowering times were noted for three years. The results
   showed a strong maternal effect for germination time and also indicated
   that germination time was not correlated with any other trait.
   Correlations between the first leafing time in the cold chamber and the
   flowering time in the field four to six years later were intermediate,
   raising doubts about the use of this correlation as an early selection
   criterion for flowering time in almond. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

   were sought which would make it possible to sow the seed a short time

   green forage. The percentage of germination increased from 55% to 81%
   after 2 months and to 92% after 3 mos. The speed of germination
   increased more rapidly than the germinability. Ripening was hastened by
   low temps. (5 C) on swollen kernels for 3-8 days. Low temp. treatment of
   the dry kernels decreased the germination. By use of a stimulation soln.
   according to Popoff (2% MnSO4 + 1% MgSO4) combined with a low temp. for
   3-8 days the complete germination rate can be obtained immediately after
   harvest. Substances which hinder respiration retard germination,
   oxidizing substances promote the germination. 4 m. short waves bring
   about only a small furtherance of the germination of the not

AB Sugar palm (Arenga pinnata) has a hard and impermeable pericarp, which
   make an obstacle for it's germination. Scarification of seed is needed
   to breakdown the physical dormancy of seeds. One of the methods to break
   the physical dormancy is stratification by soaking seed in to the water
   in some different temperature level. The aims of the study were to
   determine the effectiveness of stratification and to figure out the best
   water temperature in breaking the dormancy. A Completely Randomized
   Design (CRD) in four treatments (control, water immersion at 25°C, 50°C,
   and 75°C) with four replications was employed as research design.
   Statistical analysis was conducted using homogenity of variance,
   variance analysis, and least significant difference tests. The result
   showed that the water immersion of arenga seed at 25°C and 50°C resulted
   in the germination percentage, germination rate and test germination
   that was comparable to control. Water immersion at 75°C reduced the
   percentage of germination and germination rate, however the treatment
   could increase the germination test. Water immersion of arenga seed at
   25°C, 50°C, and 75°C were not effective to break the dormancy of sugar
   palm seed.

AB Lychnis wilfordii (Regel) Maxim is an endemic plant species that occurs
   in the wetlands of Gangwon-do, Korea. This research was conducted to
   investigate the effect of after-ripening treatment (0, 3, 6, or 9 weeks
   at 20-25 degrees C), cold stratification (0, 3, 6, or 9 weeks at 5
   degrees C), and GA(3) treatment (0, 10, 100, or 1000 mg.L-1) on L.
   wilfordii seed germination. Seeds were transferred to germination
   conditions (20 degrees C, 12 h photoperiod of florescent lamps with 26.1
   mu mol.m(-2).s(-1) PAR or darkness) following after-ripening, cold
   stratification, or GA3 treatment. In after-ripening experiments, the
   final germination percentage (FGP) of seeds with 0, 3, 6, and 9 weeks of
   after-ripening was 0, 0.7, 2.3, and 33.2% in the light condition and
   1.6, 1.9, 2.3, and 22.6% in darkness, respectively. In cold
   stratification experiments, the FGP of seeds treated with 0, 3, 6, and 9
   weeks of clod stratification was 0, 80.5, 77.0, and 83.3% in light
   conditions and 1.6, 77.8, 58.4, and 83.1% in darkness conditions,
   respectively. The mean germination time of 1,000 mg.L-1 GA(3) treatment
   was approximately five days in light and three days in darkness
   conditions, respectively. These results indicate that seed germination
   in L. wilfordii can be improved with 1,000 mg.L-1 GA(3) and cold
   stratification (3 or 6 weeks) was effective for the mass propagation of
   L. wilfordii.

AB This study investigated the most appropriate seed pretreatment of three

   N. glauca) to obtain the highest capacity and germination energy.
   Specific aspects were analysed to determine whether the application of
   pretreatment gives better results than no pretreatment (control).
   Germination through the application of two chemical compounds
   (gibberellic acid and thiourea) at different levels of concentration
   (0.5-1.0% and 200 and 600 ppm, respectively) and different periods of
   exposure, was also analysed. Two variables were calculated: relative
   germinative capacity (RGC) and average time which measures the
   germinative energy (GE). Results showed that the best pretreatment for N
   glauca and N. leoni was the treatment with low concentration of
   gibberellic acid (200 ppm) giving the highest RGC and GE. For N.
   alessandri, the highest RGC and GE were obtained through six-week
   stratification. The average germination time for N. alessandri and N.
   leoni was 16 days.

AB Prunus africana, from the moist highlands of sub-Saharan Africa, is
   subject to great exploitation because its bark is used in the treatment
   of prostate-related diseases. A better understanding of the biology of
   its seed could help the ex situ and in situ conservation of the species.
   Fifty per cent of fresh seeds (46.8% MC) from mature purple fruits
   harvested in Kenya germinated after 10 days incubation at 25degreesC.
   The germination rate was linearly related to constant temperature,
   giving a prediction for the minimum temperature for germination at ca.
   0.6degreesC. All seeds germinated at 5degreesC during 4 months fully
   hydrated storage. P. africana seed is, thus, neither dormant nor
   chilling sensitive. The relationship between equilibrium moisture
   content and relative humidity was used to construct a sorption isotherm,
   against which seed desiccation and storage responses were assessed.
   Seventy six per cent of mature seeds survived drying to 4.5% MC (22% RH)
   compared to 17% of seeds from immature purple-green fruits. Although,
   25-45% of mature seeds survived at 8-12% MC after 2 months, only 10%
   remained viable after 6-month storage at 5degreesC. This study proposes
   optimum conditions for the artificial regeneration of P. africana seeds
   and highlights the need for further experiments storing dry seeds at
   sub-zero temperatures.

   dm(-3) kinetin (kin), or 0.2 mg dm(-3) kin. GA(3) (1 mg dm(-3)) showed
   the best effect; after 5 weeks the plantlets had 1.5 -2 cm long
   cotyledons, 5 - 6 cm long roots, 88 % of embrya germinated and developed
   further. The addition of 0.5 mg dm(-3) zeatin + 0.2 mg dm(-3)
   naphtaleneacetic acid (NAA), 0.2 mg dm(-3) NAA, and 1 mg dm(-3) kinetin
   inhibited the growth of embrya. 1 mg dm(-3) kinetin + 0.1 mg dm(-3) NAA,
   0.1 mg dm(-3) zeatin and 0.2 mg dm(-3) 6-benzylaminopurine resulted in a
   compact appearance of plantlets and a lower germination rate. Divided
   embryo cultures produced plantlets via somatic embryogenesis which
   occurred only on the 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid containing media.
   The maturation of somatic embrya was observed on media without any

   germination of Pinus canariensis was feasible within a range of 15-20
   degrees C both under light and darkness, while the optimum germination
   of Pinus roxburghii was achievable at 25 degrees C under white light.
   Germination rate of Pinus roxburghii was significantly enhanced under
   white light. A brief red light pulse resulted in promoting germination
   in Pinus roxburghii; however, the enhancing effect of red light was
   reversed by a brief far-red pulse; which indicated the mediation of
   phytochrome system in seed germination. Pinus peuce seeds were deeply
   dormant and required an extended period of stratification in order to
   come out of dormancy. Pinus wallichiana seeds were less dormant as
   compared to Pinus peuce, 30 d stratification or incubation under white
   light resulted in overcoming the dormancy.

AB Acer monospessulanum is an important species of the genus Acer from
   Aceraceae family. Turcamanicum subspecies spreads in Irano-Turanian
   region as associated plant of juniper forests in highlands of Razavi
   Khorasan province and northern part of the province. Its mast year is
   every three years, germination rate of seeds and number of healthy
   matured seeds is low. Also, the seeds have dormancy period and their
   germination percentage is decreased after chilling periods.
   Unfortunately, most of the species habitats are under intense grazing
   and human intervention effects, so that the species has been encountered
   with severe destruction. Due to sexual reproduction problems,
   application of vegetative propagation methods could be advantageous in
   high quality seedling production and reclamation of the habitats. One of
   seedling production methods is propagation using in vitro techniques.
   For this purpose, explants were collected from their natural habitats,
   and their regeneration was assessed in different hormonal treatments.
   Embryogenesis percentage in different hormonal treatments was
   investigated. Applying different hormonal treatments, callus
   regeneration was observed only in 0.1 and 0.5 mg/l of TDZ hormone
   concentration. Shoot number, shoot growth and shoot vigority were
   affected by different concentrations of TDZ hormones. MS media
   supplemented by 0.5 mg/l TDZ had the highest shoot production. But
   vigority and shoot length were not significantly different by utilizing
   different hormonal treatments. Finally, MS basal media and TDZ hormone
   are suitable for regeneration from callus in the valuable tree species.

   germination in maize and chilli was significantly higher in full light

   germination of beans and mustard. The best germination (96.7%) for
   lady's finger was under the lowest light condition. Mean germination
   time of the test crops did not vary with light conditions except for
   lady's finger. Low light condition stimulated shoot length in the test
   crops. Contrarily, exposure to full sunlight (canopy <10-40%; max. -
   10000 lx) significantly enhanced root growth in chilli, beans and lady's
   finger. In maize and mustard medium light (canopy 40-70%; Partial shade
   with max. - 7000 lx) seemed to stimulate root elongation. It can be
   concluded that different crops have different light requirement for
   their germination and growth. Productivity of these crops in homegarden
   agroforestry can be enhanced by manipulating overhead canopy adopting
   efficient canopy management techniques.

AB The present-day diversity of European flora in temperate mountain ranges
   was mainly formed by the negative effects of Pleistocene glaciation,
   which caused extinctions, restricted survival in situ, and subsequent
   re-colonization. Only rarely can we find species that have retained the
   molecular information of in situ survival. One such example is the
   extremely rare H. pastinacifolia Rchb., a monotypic genus and a narrow
   endemic of a mountain plateau south-east of the Julian Alps (Slovenia).
   We investigated the germination behavior and dispersal indications,
   which are often closely related to rarity and persistence and thus
   valuable for species conservation. Additionally, results about H.
   pastinacifolia help us to understand better what kind of species
   survived glaciations in Europe in situ. Our results show that these
   seeds have an underdeveloped embryo and require an ecologically relevant
   moist chilling period of about 100 days. The temperature sequence of the
   colder period that H. pastinacifolia seeds received in nature was 20/15
   degrees C (52 days), 10/5 degrees C (40 days), 5/0 degrees C (65 days),
   10/0 degrees C (45 days), 15/5 degrees C (21 days). The germination rate
   was high, significantly increased by scarification, and therefore
   prevented long-term seed bank establishment. We found cryptic seed
   differences expressed by two types of dormancy, each related to the
   order of the umbel: simple and complex morphophysiological dormancy for
   the lateral and the main umbel, respectively. Seed dispersal was very
   much influenced by precipitation in autumn. The germination and
   dispersal characteristics could explain the rarity and at the same time
   the persistence of H. pastinacifolia.
