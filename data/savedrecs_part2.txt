AB Bilhar or Mountain Kandall (Dorema aucheri) belongs to Apiacea family
   that contains flavonoid and coumarine compounds. Since, propagation of
   this plant in natural habitats occurs through seed and due to deep
   dormancy, the identification of different seed dormancy breaking methods
   is necessary for preservation of this species. In this respect,
   different methods, including chilling, washing and gibberellic acid was
   studied, on the seeds gathered from Kohgiloyeh and Boyerahmad province.
   For this reason, a factorial experiment with three factors was done
   based on completely randomized design in three replications, in the
   faculty of agriculture, Yasouj University, on 2012. Experimental factors
   were included, chilling period (stratification periods of 3 and 4
   weeks), gibberellic acid (zero and 1500 ppm) and washing (washing with
   distilled water and non-washable). Results showed that 4 weeks chilling
   treatment had maximum germination percentage and germination rate and
   seedling vigor. Also maximum root and shoot dry weight was obtained from
   the seeds of this treatment. Whereas, double and triple interaction
   effects for germination percentage, epicotyl and hypocotyl length were
   not significant. Germination percentage was better in 4 weeks prechilled
   seed than 3 weeks. Obtained results from this research showed that
   Bilhar seeds have the physiological dormancy.

AB Astragalus, is one of perennial and various species which is expanded in
   an Iranian's ranges. In regard to the expansion of plant shoot in
   grassland with steep, we can use it to prevent soil erosion. Also, we
   use some species of Astragalus to gum tragacanth extract. This study
   aimed to identify methods of dormancy breaking and characters of
   germination in four species that was designed. Seeds of four species A.
   brevidens, A. podolobus, A. caragana, and A. cyclophyllus were purchased
   from the Seeds Institute of the name of Isfahan Pakan Bazr. Treatments
   used for the experiment were dry chilling for 15 and 30 days, moist
   chilling for 15 and 30 days, scarification with sandpaper, and
   gibberellic acid (GA3, four levels). The results demonstrated that
   treatments of scarification and moist chilling for 15 days are the most
   effective treatments to increase seed germination. The majority of
   species moist chilling for 15 days can significantly increase the
   germination index while minimum germination index belongs to
   scarification, which consequently increased the mean germination time.
   Between the species, the A. caragana has the most germination percentage
   and germination index, which shows the highest compatibility of this
   species to the ecological condition in an Iranian Ranges.

AB Wild oat (A. ludoviciana [A. sterilis subsp. ludoviciana]) has two seeds
   in a spikelet that have different physiological behaviour in regard of
   seed germination. The upper seed of spikelet is smaller and has deeper
   dormancy than the lower seed. The range of temperature for germination
   is 5°C to 25°C and optimum temperature is 15°C. Both kinds of seeds
   showed higher germination rate in low temperatures thus, 5 and 10°C are
   better for germination than that of 20 and 25°C. Germination was late
   and slow at 5°C. This study revealed that alternative temperatures
   (15:5°C) was the optimum condition for seed germination. After one and
   two months, chilling caused 63.5% and 97% germination rate in the lower
   seeds, respectively. Also it caused 11.5% and 92% germination rate for
   upper seeds. The results showed that chilling for two months was
   necessary for seed dormancy breaking. Nitrate ions caused 32.75%
   germination rate in upper seeds and 57.25% germination rate in lower
   seeds compared with those of the controls which were 11.5% and 13.75%,
   respectively. GA3 was more effective for stimulating germination
   compared with nitrate ions or cytokinin. Soil stirring caused high
   germination in buried seeds in different depths of soil.

AB The aim of this research was to overcome abortion postzygote
   incompatibility, and rescuing of hybrid embryos of early and
   mid-ripening plum cultivars, obtained from interspecific crossing
   between two plum cultivars (P. salicina L.) as female parents with four
   apricot cultivars (P. armeniaca L.) as male parents. The effects of
   cultivar, embryo developmental stage, plant growth regulators (PGRs),
   cold treatment, embryo size and removing seed coats were investigated on
   embryo germination at in vitro conditions. Results showed that the best
   conditions for embryo rescue were: harvesting embryos at 65 d after
   pollination (DAP) (91.33%), using completed MS medium with 0.5 mgL(-1)
   6-benzyladenine (BA) and 1 mgL(-1) indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), and
   embryo Stratification for 65 and 75 DAP- embryos at 4 degrees C for 30
   d. Larger embryos testa removing treatment showed higher germination
   rates. Additionally, artificial neural networks (ANNs) was used to model
   two outputs which are the embryo generation percentage (GP) and complete
   plant percentage (CFP) based on three inputs including BA, IBA and
   embryo developmental stage (EDS). According to Multilayer 29 Perceptmn
   (MLP), the best germination rate (100%) and the highest percentage of
   complete plant (100%) can be obtained by culturing the embryos at 65 DAP
   on MS medium containing 0.69 ingL(-1) BA and 0.95 ingL(-1) IBA, or at 75
   DAP on MS medium containing 0.94 mgL(-1) BA and 0.98 ingL(-1) IBA. The
   MLP results showed a high correlation between the expected and the
   experimental values, which was 91.99%, 89.33% for GP and CFP,
   respectively. The results of the traditional statistical analysis by
   using Two Way ANOVA method were consistent with the results of the model
   obtained using MLP. Taking as a whole, this research developed an
   optimal protocol that may be useful in rescuing plum embryos in breeding
   programs.

AB Bitter vetch is an important legume crop cultivated for forage and seed
   yield in the Mediterranean, West Asia, and North Africa regions.
   Delaying seed harvest of bitter vetch may increase seed losses due to
   pod shattering; however, early harvest may influence seed dormancy and
   the ability of seed to germinate. Field experiments were conducted at
   two locations in Jordan to study the effect of maturity stage on
   germination and dormancy of fresh (before drying), air-dried, and
   dry-prechilled (at 5degreesC for 8 days) seeds of bitter vetch. Pods
   were harvested at three development stages: full-seed pod (FS), yellow
   pod (YP), and brown pod (BP). Percentage of normal, abnormal, hard, and
   dead seeds at 14 days after planting in standard germination tests was
   recorded for the fresh, air-dried, and dry-prechilled seeds harvested at
   the three development stages. Germination counts of normal seedlings at
   4, 7, 10, and 14 days after planting was used to calculate the
   germination rate index (GRI). For the fresh seeds, germination did not
   exceed 30% when seeds were harvested at the FS stage, and decreased to
   0% at the YP stage. All non-germinated fresh seeds harvested at the YP
   stage were dormant. Air-drying and dry-prechilling treatments improved
   seed germination at the YP and BP stages. Maximum germination was
   achieved in air-dried and dry-prechilled seeds harvested at the BP
   stage. The percentage of hard seeds was the highest for air-dried seeds
   harvested at the FS stage. Percentage of hard and dormant seeds was
   decreased to the minimum When seeds were harvested at the BP stage and
   exposed to air-drying and dry-prechilling treatment before germination.
   Dry-prechilled seeds had higher GRI than fresh and air-dried seeds when
   seeds were harvested at the BP stage. In conclusion, maximum germination
   and minimum dormancy was achieved for air-dried and dry-prechilled seeds
   harvested at the BP stage. Dry-prechilling treatment increased the speed
   of germination for seeds harvested at the BP stage. Presence of hard
   seeds reduced the germination of air-dried seeds harvested at the YP
   stage. Bitter vetch seeds harvested at the YP stage may require
   scarification and a longer prechilling treatment to overcome seed
   dormancy observed at this stage.

TI Evolution of multiple postzygotic barriers between species of the

AB Species are often defined by their ability to interbreed (i.e.,
   Biological Species Concept), but determining how and why reproductive
   isolation arises between new species can be challenging. In theMimulus
   tilingiispecies complex, three species (M. caespitosa,M. minor, andM.
   tilingii) are largely allopatric and grow exclusively at high elevations
   (>2000m). The extent to which geographic separation has shaped patterns
   of divergence among the species is not well understood. In this study,
   we determined that the three species are morphologically and genetically
   distinct, yet recently diverged. Additionally, we performed reciprocal
   crosses within and between thespecies and identified several strong
   postzygotic reproductive barriers, including hybrid seed inviability, F1
   hybrid necrosis, and F1 hybrid male and female sterility. In this study,
   such postzygotic barriers are so strong that a cross between any species
   pair in theM. tilingiicomplex would cause nearly complete reproductive
   isolation. We consider how geographical and topographical patterns may
   have facilitated the evolution of several postzygotic barriers and
   contributed to speciation of closely related members within theM.
   tilingiispecies complex. Plant materials When we began this study, we
   tentatively classified plants from 12 populations (17 maternal families)
   within the M. tilingiispecies complex into three putative species:M.
   caespitosa,M. minor,M. tilingii.All maternal families were
   self-fertilized for one to eight generations. To generate experimental
   plants, seeds were sown onto wet paper towels in petri dishes, sealed
   with parafilm, and cold-stratified at 4°C for seven days to disrupt seed
   dormancy. After cold-stratification, petri dishes were transferred to a
   growth chamber that provided constant supplemental light at 26°C. After
   germination, seedlings were transplanted to 3.5 pots with moistFafard 4P
   growing mix(Sun Gro Horticulture, Agawam, Massachusetts, USA)and
   transferred to a growth chamber with 16h days at 23°C and 8h nights at
   16°C. For assessments of hybrid plant viability and fertility, seedlings
   were allowed to establish in the growth chamber then moved to a 16h,
   23°C/8h,16°Cgreenhouse. Morphological assessment To characterize
   genetically-based morphological differences among species within theM.
   tilingiicomplex, we grew 66 plants from 11 populations (16 maternal
   families) together in a growth chamber.We measured a suite of 16 floral
   and vegetative traits. First, we measured four leaf traits: when the
   third leaf pair was fully expanded, we used one leaf from the second
   leaf pair to measure leaf length and width, petiole length, and number
   of trichomes that exerted past the edge of the leaf (then standardized
   by leaf length). Next, we measured ten flower traits from one flower on
   the second flowering pair: corolla height and width, corolla tube length
   and width, stamen length, pistil length, pedicel length, capsule length,
   calyx length, and degree of flower nodding. When performing floral
   measurements, we also measured two stolon traits: number of stolons and
   stolon length. All traits were measured using calipers, except for the
   degree of flower nodding, which was measured on photographs using imageJ
   (Rasband 1997). Postmating reproductive isolating barriers To
   investigate postmating reproductive isolating barriers amongspecies in
   theM. tilingiicomplex, weperformed a crossing experiment using plants
   from 13 maternal families across 10 populations (maternal families:M.
   caespitosa= 7,M. minor= 2,M. tilingii= 4).For this experiment, we used
   some of the same individuals as in the morphological analysis above but
   supplemented them with full siblings from each maternal family.
   Intraspecific crosses (CxC, MxM, and TxT, where C =M. caespitosa,M =M.
   minor, and T =M. tilingii) included two types: 1) crosses within
   maternal families (i.e., between full sibs), and 2) crosses between
   maternal families within species.Three days prior to each cross, we
   emasculated maternal parents to avoid contamination from
   self-pollination. For intraspecific crosses, we generated 62 unique
   maternal-family cross combinations and 160 total crosses (CxC = 44, MxM
   = 4, TxT = 14; 1-6 fruits per cross combination).For interspecific
   crosses, we performed 86 unique and 210 total interspecific crosses (CxM
   =10, MxC =12, MxT = 8, TxM = 7, TxC = 25, CxT = 24; 1-8 fruits per cross
   combination). We used these crosses to assess the following
   sequentially-acting postmating reproductive isolating barriers: 1)
   postmating, prezygotic reproductive isolation, 2) hybrid seed
   inviability, 3) later-acting hybrid inviability, and 4) hybrid male and
   female sterility. Postmating, prezygotic isolation To assess postmating,
   prezygotic reproductive isolation, we measured seed production per fruit
   from crosses within and between species. Seed viability We used two
   different methods as a proxy for measuring seed viability. First, we
   performed a visual seed assessment. Recent studies inMimulushave shown
   that inviable hybrid seeds are often darkened and/or shriveled (Garneret
   al.2016, Onealet al.2016, Coughlanet al.2020). Following these studies,
   we scored round, plump seeds as fully developed and seeds with irregular
   phenotypes (darkened, shriveled, or wrinkled) as underdeveloped. Second,
   for a subset of crosses, we also assessed seed viability by scoring seed
   germination. For intraspecific crosses, we measured seed germination
   rates for 48 unique and76 total crosses (CxC = 36, MxM = 3, TxT = 9; 1-3
   fruits per cross combination). For interspecific crosses, we scored
   germination for 72 unique and 133 total crosses (CxM = 8, MxC = 7, MxT =
   7, TxM = 7, TxC = 20, CxT = 23;1-4 fruits per cross combination). To
   determine germination rates, wesowed all seeds from each fruit onto wet
   paper towels in petri dishes (100 seeds per petri dish to avoid
   overcrowding). Petri dishes were sealed with parafilm, cold-stratified
   at 4°C for seven days, and then transferred to a growth chamber that
   provided constant light at 26°C. Ten days later, we scored germination
   rate as the number of seedlings that had germinated per total number of
   seeds planted per fruit. F1 viability To investigate later-acting
   (post-seed) hybrid inviability, we tracked survival to flowering in a
   subset of the seedlings from the germination tests described in the
   previous section. We transplanted seedlings from petri dishes into flats
   with 6-cm cells and transferred them to a 16h, 23°C/8h,16°Cgreenhouse.
   We transplanted 5-16 offspring from each of 27 unique intraspecific
   crosses (CxC = 17, MxM = 2, TxT = 8; total intraspecific offspring =
   315) and 1-23 F1 hybrids from each of 29 unique interspecific crosses
   (F1s: CxM = 5, MxC = 4, TxM = 4, TxC = 9, CxT = 7; total interspecific
   offspring = 334). All interspecific cross combinations were represented
   in these analyses except for MxT, which did not produce viable offspring
   due to the severe seed inviability phenotype.For each individual, we
   scored the number of days to flowering as a proxy for viability. F1
   sterility Finally, using a subset of the intraspecific and hybrid
   offspring grown to flowering, we investigated both male and female
   fertility. We assessed male fertility in 4-14 offspring from each of
   27unique intraspecific crosses (CxC = 17, MxM = 2, TxT = 8; total
   intraspecific offspring = 206)and 4-13 F1 hybrids from each of 28
   interspecific crosses(F1s: CxM = 5, MxC = 4, TxM = 4, TxC = 9, CxT = 6;
   total interspecific offspring = 193). For each individual, we collected
   anthers from 1-3 of the first four flowers and suspended the pollen in a
   lacto-phenol aniline blue stain, which stains viable pollen a dark blue
   color.To estimate pollen viability for each individual, we determined
   the proportion of viable pollen grains from a haphazard sample of about
   100 pollen grains per flower. In a few cases, flowers did not produce
   functional anthers or pollen; these flowers were excluded from further
   analyses. To investigate female fertility, we performed supplemental
   hand-pollinations on intraspecific and hybrid offspring using one or
   both of their fertile parents as pollen donors. For each of these
   hand-pollinations, we counted the number of seeds produced per fruit. We
   used this approach to assess female fertility in 2-9 offspring from each
   of27unique intraspecific crosses (CxC = 17, MxM = 2, TxT = 8; total
   intraspecific offspring = 119, 1-3 fruits per individual) and 1-7F1
   hybrids from each of 27 interspecific crosses(F1s: CxM = 5, MxC = 4, TxM
   = 4, TxC = 9, CxT = 5; total interspecific offspring = 112, 1-4 fruits
   per individual). We grew maternal families belonging tothree species in
   theMimulus tilingiicomplexin a common garden and assessed for
   differences in morphology. Additionally, we performedintra- and
   interspecific crossesand tested for postmating reproductive barriers,
   including seed set differeces, seed viability, F1 viability, and F1
   fertility. Here, we include our file (tilingiiCH1_rawdata) containing
   fourraw data sheetslabeled: "raw_morphological_data",
   "normalized_morphological_data", "F0_postzygotic_barriers", and
   "F1_postzygotic_barriers". For the first data sheet
   ("raw_morphological_data"), columns A-Cincludeinformation onmaternal
   families that weremeasured for 16 floral and vegetative traits (raw
   values are listedin columns E-W). NAs denote measurements that were not
   taken (n=1) or structures that were not present (n=2).  To perform a
   linear discriminant analysis (LDA) with the morphological data,
   wetransformed trait values to meet LDA assumptions (i.e., that values
   are normally distributed). The second data sheet
   ("normalized_morphological_data") lists the normalized trait values that
   were used for our LDA. To denote iftrait values were transformed and how
   they were transformed, we included descriptive namesin the column
   headers. For example, we performed a log transformation for petiole
   length; therefore, we named the column header:
   "petiole_length_log_transformed". We list our raw data for intra and
   interspecific total seed set and seed viability (morphological and
   germination rate)in the data sheet named: "F0_postzygotic_barriers". In
   this data sheet, columns A-F includedetails of the cross, including the
   maternal and paternal lines,their respective species names,and the date
   the cross was collected. Each row represents a single fruit. The
   following columns include raw values for fruits with seed
   viabilityassessed through a visual assessment and seeds in a fruit that
   were planted to scoregermination rate. For our last data sheet
   ("F1_postzygotic_barriers"), we include details regarding F1 inviability
   and sterility. In this sheet, each row is an individual plant, where
   individuals grouped by borders are offspring of the same
   uniquecross.Columns C-E list the specific maternal and paternal parents
   and the species cross name. Columns J-O describe female fertility, where
   the total seed per fruit is listed specifically in columns L-O. Columns
   P-Y describe pollen fertility, including pollen viability from a single
   flower, up to three flowers. Column Z describes hybrid inviability.

AB The diversity of chilis in Oaxaca is one of the most extensive in
   Mexico. Growers select seeds in the traditional manner: information on
   its quality is unknown. The aim of this research was to compare the
   physical and physiological quality of seeds and seedlings of three
   native types to chili (Huacle, De agua and Pasilla) and of the
   commercial Green pepper as control. Fifteen variables were evaluated in
   seed and twelve in seedlings. The laboratory experiments were
   established under a completely randomized design. Means of the variables
   were compared using the Tukey test (alpha=0.05). Results showed that
   Pasilla chili had the highest values in seed size and weight, which was
   1.44 g heavier than the control and 2.09 to 3.73 g higher than native
   types. Haucle chili and green pepper had a 90% germination rate, while
   chili De agua and Pasilla chili had germination rates of 51 and 38%,
   respectively Huacle chili had the highest germination rate index (29.89)
   and seedling vigor index (992.25). The top highest values of number of
   normal seedlings were obtained in the control and Huacle chili seedlings
   (72 and 88%); also, the latter had the longest plumule (3.36 cm) and
   radicle (7.67 cm) values. Both Huacle and Pasilla chili seedlings had
   larger values in height, stem thickness, number of leaves, leaf area and
   slenderness index than De agua and Green pepper. Huacle chili had good
   physical and physiological quality similar to the seeds of the
   commercial Green pepper.

AB In mammography screening programmes, women are screened according to a
   one-size-fits-all principle. Tailored screening, based on risk levels,
   may lead to a better balance of benefits and harms. With microsimulation
   modelling, we determined optimal mammography screening strategies for
   women at lower (relative risk [RR] 0.75) and higher (RR 1.8) than
   average risk of breast cancer, eligible for screening, using the
   incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of current uniform screening
   in the Netherlands (biennial [B] 50-74) as a threshold ICER. Strategies
   varied by interval (annual [A], biennial, triennial [T]) and age range.
   The number of life-years gained (LYG), breast cancer deaths averted,
   overdiagnosed cases, false-positive mammograms, ICERs and harm-benefit
   ratios were calculated. Optimal risk-based screening scenarios, below
   the threshold ICER of euro8883/LYG, were T50-71 (euro7840/LYG) for
   low-risk and B40-74 (euro6062/LYG) for high-risk women. T50-71 screening
   in low-risk women resulted in a 33% reduction in false-positive
   findings, a similar reduction in costs and improved harm-benefit ratios
   compared to the current screening schedule. B40-74 in high-risk women
   led to an increase in screening benefit, compared to current B50-74
   screening, but a relatively higher increase in false-positive findings.
   In conclusion, optimal screening consisted of a longer interval and
   lower stopping age than current uniform screening for low-risk women,
   and a lower starting age for high-risk women. Extending the interval for
   women at lower risk from biennial to triennial screening reduced harms
   and costs while maintaining most of the screening benefit.

AB The present investigation attempted to assess the influence of two light
   sources, LED versus fluorescent light, on seed germination of nine
   aromatic species belonging to the genus Artemisia, Atriplex,
   Chenopodium, Salicornia, Sanguisorba, Portulaca and Rosmarinus.
   Pre-germination test was carried out in petri dishes, evidencing the
   need to overcome seed dormancy through cold stratification in Salicornia
   europaea. Thereafter, seeds were germinated in small trays with peat
   moss substrate in two growth chambers illuminated with either LED or
   fluorescent light featuring similar photosynthetic photon flux density.
   Germination lasted 20 days, during which time five indexes of
   germination performance (germination percentage, speed of germination,
   germination energy, germination rate index, and mean daily germination)
   were evaluated. At the end, shoot length and seedling fresh weight were
   assessed as early growth traits. Data are made available to allow
   critical evaluation of experimental outcome. (C) 2018 The Authors.

AB Vertebrates are important seed dispersers for many plants. In addition
   to transport of seeds, ingestion often affects the proportion or rate of
   seed germination. We present one of the first studies comparing the
   effects of different waterbird species on the seeds of a subcosmopolitan
   pondweed, Potamogeton pectinatus. We also present the first comparison
   of the effects of digestion by ducks (mallard Anas platyrhynchos,
   shoveler A. clypeata and wigeon A. penelope) and physical-chemical
   "simulation of digestion" on pondweed seed germination. In two
   experiments differing in the length of the preceding stratification
   period, two to three individuals per duck species were force-fed 150
   seeds each. Average retrieval, total germination and germination rate
   did not differ significantly between duck species. Germination rate was
   higher for duck ingested seeds, intermediate for scarified seeds (i.e.
   after mechanical removal of the epicarp+mesocarp) and lowest for the
   controls and acid treated seeds, independently of the length of the
   stratification period. Total germination, however, did not differ
   significantly among duck-ingested, scarified, control and acid treated
   seeds. Consequently the changes in germination rate after ingestion by
   ducks seem related to the grinding treatment in the gut and unrelated to
   exposure to acidic conditions. The coexistence of ingested and
   uningested seeds within a given seed cohort will increase the
   diversification of seed germination patterns, which can favour the
   colonisation of habitats characterised by unpredictable environmental
   conditions.

AB The species Baccharis dracunculifolia, known as alecrim-do-campo is very
   rough, of great economic importance, recommended for recovery of
   degraded areas, but is little explored by propagation through seeds. In
   order to understand aspects of reproductive biology of B.
   dracunculifolia of achenes, this study aims to verify the influence of
   pre-germination treatment and the influence of different germination
   temperatures in the performance of seed germination. The seeds were
   placed in translucent germination boxes, with four replicates of 30
   seeds for each treatment. Germination was carried out with
   pre-germination treatment stratification (5°C) for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
   days, with a photoperiod of 14 h with light and 10 h in dark, in a
   germination chamber B.O.D. The 15°C treatment was carried out with 0, 1,
   2, 3, 4 and 5 days with pre-germination treatment stratification (5°C)
   and successively for all treatments. After this period, the same
   photoperiod of 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35°C remained. The germination was
   evaluated for 30 days, considering the number of germinated seeds; those
   showing radicle protrusion of less than 2 mm, the speed index, the
   average time and average speed of germination. The temperature of 20°C
   without pre-germinative treatment provided 17.8% of germination. The
   highest speed of germination was obtained at 30°C with pre-germination
   treatment stratification (5°C) for 4 days. The temperature of 35°C
   inhibited germination and there was no significant effect on mean
   germination time. The pre-germinating treatment for three days, combined
   with the temperature of 20°C, provided a higher average speed of
   germination. Thus, it appears that the pre-germination treatment
   stimulated germination of achenes, suggesting that longer periods of
   chill accumulation increased seed germination subjected to high
   temperatures.

   (-) were treated with 1000 mg/l, 2000 mg/l and 3000 mg/l GA(3)
   concentrations, cold stratified at +4 +/- 1 degrees C for 25 and 50
   days, punctured and seed coat removed to overcome and assess the
   mechanism of laurel seed dormancy. A period of 50 days cold
   stratification and removing seed coat significantly increased
   germination rate to 55% +/- 1.91 (Mean +/- SE) and 85% +/- 3.00,
   respectively. None of the seeds with pericarp germinated regardless of
   treatment they underwent. Results suggested that seed dormancy was
   mainly due to pericarp and perhaps inhibitors linked to seed coat.

AB Seeds of Kalopanax pictus [K. septemlobus] usually require 2 years to
   initiate germination. We examined the effectiveness of 3 stratification
   treatments in reducing this period by 1 year. The treatments were: (1)
   constantly maintained temperature of 25°C; (2) 30°C for 12 h, followed
   by 20°C for 12 h; and (3) room temperature (mean overall temperature:
   22.1°C, mean daily maximum temperature: 25.6°C and mean daily minimum
   temperature: 18.5°C). Each treatment lasted for 4 months, after which
   there followed a 3-month 5°C stratification treatment. The room
   temperature treatment produced the highest germination rate (53.3-82%),
   followed by the 30°C/20°C treatment (47.2-71%), with the 25°C treatment
   producing the lowest germination rate (2.7-13%). We conclude that the
   room temperature treatment provides a simple and effective method to
   shorten the period to initiation of germination for K. pictus.

AB A comprehensive study on breaking dormancy of mountain ash (Sorbus
   luristanica Bornm.) endemic species is still lacking. Here, the high
   efficient potentials of multiwall carbon nanotubes were used to break
   seed dormancy and improve seed germination in mountain ash. First, the
   seeds were primed with different concentrations of the nano-material
   including 0, 75, 150, 250, 350 and 500 mg l-1 during 24 hours. Then warm
   (two weeks) and cold (three or four months) stratifications were
   performed. The results showed that the seeds require cold stratification
   for at least 3 months. After the cold stratification period, the seeds
   were transferred to petri dishes in germinator. Daily seed germinations
   were recorded during 22 days. Eventually seed germination parameters
   such as seed germination percent, germination speed as well as mean
   germination time were calculated and compared. To understand the effects
   of nanomaterials on the seedlings from different treatments, the
   subsequent growth of seeds was studied. The results revealed that all
   germination parameters were improved by 350 mg l-1 treatment. The
   microscopic seed observations showed that the nano-priming treatments
   led to seed endocarp abrasion and increased oxygen and moisture
   infiltration into seeds. Increasing root height growth was associated
   with the most considerable effects of treatments. Conclusively, it seems
   that increase in seedling moisture is one of the functional mechanisms
   of the MWCNT.

AB Persimmon (Diospyros kaki) is an important subtropical, monoecious,
   dioeocious and polygamous tree which belongs to Ebenaceae family.
   Because of low total seed and low viability seed in persimmon, grafting
   on seedling rootstock is generally used for its propagation. The common
   rootstock is Diospyros lotus, but its seeds have long dormancy. So, the
   study was carried out to investigate the effects of stratification (0,
   25, 50 and 70 days) at 4-7°C, scarification with (97%) sulphuric acid
   (0, 2.5, 5 and 7.5 minute) and GA3 (0, 250, 500 and 750 mgL-1) on seed
   germination of D. lotus. Results showed that the most germination rate
   was observed in GA3 at 250 mgL-1. Stratification for 70 days had the
   most germination percent. The most germination uniformity was observed
   in GA3 at 500 mgL-1. In scarification plus stratification, the
   germination percent was lower than control and stratification.

AB Various treatments were used to remove seed dormancy of Alisma
   plantago-aquatica and Scirpus mucronatus, two weeds infesting rice
   crops. Scarification of A. plantago-aquatica achenes with chloroform or
   ether and then with 80% sulfuric acid for 5 minutes gave the highest
   cumulative germination (c. 80%). Mechanical scarification also
   stimulated seed germination. These results, plus observations made with
   an SEM, suggest that A. plantago-aquatica dormancy is exogenous and
   related to the seed coat characteristics that mechanically constrain the
   embryo and impede germination. Stratification and vernalization
   treatments were used on achenes of S. mucronatus. Chilling treatments
   increased both germination rate and the number of germinated seeds. The
   effects of vernalization and "artificial" stratification on
   germinability was similar. S. mucronatus appears to possess an
   endogenous embryo-related dormancy, which is effectively removed by at
   least a month of achene chilling.

AB Yellow-cedar (Chamaecyparis nootkatensis [D. Don] Spach) seeds exhibit
   prolonged coat-imposed dormancy following their dispersal from the
   parent plant. Analyses were undertaken using S-(+)-[H-3] abscisic acid
   (ABA) to monitor the capacity of embryos to metabolize ABA following
   their isolation from seeds subjected to various dormancy-breaking and
   control treatments. Radiolabelled phaseic acid (PA) and dihydrophaseic
   acid (DPA) were detected in embryos and, to a greater extent in the
   surrounding media, by 48 h regardless of whether the embryos had been
   excised from seed previously subjected to only a 3 d soak or to a full
   dormancy-breaking treatment. Of the two enantiomers of ABA, only the
   natural S-(+)-ABA effectively inhibited germination of isolated embryos.
   A metabolism-resistant synthetic ABA analogue
   S-[8',8',8',9',9',9']-hexadeuteroabscisic acid, S-(+)-d6-ABA,
   consistently slowed the germination rate of excised embryos to a greater
   extent than that caused by natural S-(+)-ABA. The deuterium-labelled
   ring methyl groups of the analogue made it more resistant to oxidation
   by yellow-cedar embryos and thus rendered the analogue more persistent
   and possessing greater activity. With increasing time of exposure to
   moist chilling, yellow-cedar embryos became increasingly insensitive to
   both ABA and to the analogue. Subjecting seed to chemical treatments
   (GA(3) in combination with 1-propanol) prior to moist chilling strongly
   enhanced the germinability of whole seeds. This treatment also had a
   relatively greater impact on ABA metabolism than did moist chilling
   alone, as indicated by a greater capacity of S-(+)-d6-ABA to inhibit the
   germination of embryos as compared to S-(+)-ABA. Moist chilling was most
   critical for reduced ABA sensitivity of embryos. A change in the
   embryo's ability to metabolize ABA and reduced embryo sensitivity to ABA
   are two factors associated with dormancy termination of whole seeds of
   yellow cedar; a change in only one of these factors is insufficient to
   elicit high germinability.

AB Giant ragweed germination is delayed by both a physiological dormancy of
   the embryo (embryo dormancy) and an inhibitory influence of
   embryo-covering structures (covering structure-enforced [CSE] dormancy).
   To clarify the roles of embryo and CSE dormancy in giant ragweed
   seedling emergence timing, we conducted two experiments to address the
   following objectives: (1) determine changes in germinability for giant
   ragweed dispersal units (hereafter "involucres") and their components
   under natural burial conditions, and (2) compare embryo and CSE dormancy
   alleviation and emergence periodicity between successional and
   agricultural populations. In Experiment 1, involucres were buried in
   crop fields at Columbus, OH, periodically excavated, and brought to the
   laboratory for dissection. Involucres, achenes, and embryos were then
   subjected to germination assays at 20 C. In Experiment 2, temporal
   patterns of seedling emergence were determined at a common burial site.
   Reductions in embryo and CSE dormancy were compared with
   controlled-environment stratification followed by germination assays at
   12 and 20 C, temperatures representative of soil conditions in spring
   and summer. Results indicated that overwinter dormancy loss involved
   sequential reductions in embryo and CSE dormancy. CSE dormancy, which
   may limit potential for fatal germination during fall, was caused by the
   pericarp and/or embryo-covering structures within the pericarp. In
   Experiment 2, successional populations emerged synchronously in early
   spring, whereas agricultural populations emerged throughout the growing
   season. Levels of embryo dormancy were greater in the agricultural
   populations than the successional populations, but CSE dormancy levels
   were similar among populations. In 12 C germination assays, embryo
   dormancy levels were positively correlated with time required to reach
   95% cumulative emergence (run 1: r = 0.81, P = 0.03; run 2: r = 0.76, P
   = 0.05). These results suggest that late-season emergence in giant
   ragweed involves high levels of embryo dormancy that prevent germination
   at low temperatures in spring.

AB The timing of seed germination is thought to play an important role for
   species abundance and community composition in alpine habitats. Seed
   dormancy and germination responses to temperature and light of two
   widespread alpine sedges were investigated in order to gain insight into
   mechanisms regulating germination in the field.
   Seeds of Carex ferruginea germinated at high temperatures when freshly
   matured and were thus conditionally dormant. Germination percentages
   increased markedly due to dry storage and cold stratification,
   accompanied by a decrease of the minimum temperature for germination.
   Freshly-matured seeds of C. frigida required cold stratification to
   release strict dormancy, but germination was restricted to high
   temperatures (> 15 degreesC). The existence of a carry-over mechanism,
   preventing the major fraction of current-year seeds to germinate even
   under optimum conditions in the next growing season was shown for this
   species. Seeds of both species showed very little germination in
   darkness and attained a germination peak in light after three month of
   stratification. The period of cold-stratification required to break
   dormancy was not related to winter duration as has been found in several
   species from high altitudes in America.
   Seeds buried outdoors underwent seasonal changes in dormancy, a trait
   which was hitherto not known in alpine plant species.
   Primary seed dormancy, a requirement for relatively high germination
   temperatures in stratified seeds and the induction of secondary dormancy
   in early summer by increasing temperatures restrict the 'germination
   window' to a short period after snowmelt in both species. Such a
   cautious type of seed regeneration may increase the chance of a seedling
   becoming established at the expense of the number of germinating seeds.
   This strategy is based on a light requirement for germination, enabling
   both species to built-up a large seed reservoir in the soil.

AB Amsonia tabernaemontana is a perennial species belonging to the flora of
   North America. It adapts well to temperate and cold climates. The plant
   is interesting because its leaves contain rutine in a concentration of
   about 4 - 5 %, and it could be grown extensively in marginal areas.
   The seeds of A. tabernaemontana are characterized by slow and uneven
   germination. The present study aimed at investigating the best
   conditions for a good and uniform germination. Seeds of two populations
   from two areas around Piacenza were bred in dish and soil with three
   types of treatment (water + cold; GA3 1 mM; GA3 10 mM), plus one
   untreated test.
   The treatment with the highest concentration of gibberellin proved to be
   the one which gave the best results for germination percentage (G %) and
   average germination time (AGT), both in new and one-year-old seeds.
   The study also shows the preliminary results on the rutine content of
   several samples of A. tabernaemontana grown in our environmental
   conditions.

AB The effect of cold stratification (CS) and gibberellic acid (GA(3))
   alone and in combination on in vitro germination of Actinidia arguta and
   Actinidia chinensis seeds was studied. Sterile seeds of the two plant
   species were stratified at 4 degrees C for 28 and 42 days. Batches of
   stratified and non-stratified (control) seeds from both plant species
   were germinated on plant growth regulator-free Murashige and Skoog (MS)
   media and also on sterile filter paper bridges moistened with dH(2)O and
   GA(3) concentrations of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000 and 2500 ppm. In the two
   plant species, seeds from the control and the CS treatments alone did
   not germinate on MS medium. However on filter paper bridges, seeds cold
   stratified for 28 days yielded only 8 and 20% germination percentage
   (GP) in A. arguta and A. chinensis, respectively, whereas CS for 42 days
   did not promote germination. In A. arguta, treatments of non-stratified
   seeds with GA(3) resulted in 91% optimum GP at 1572 ppm GA(3) and
   optimum 29 days mean germination time (MGT) at 1678 ppm GA(3). In A.
   chinensis, 48% optimum GP and 24 days optimum MGT were achieved at 2225
   and 2033 ppm GA(3) concentrations, respectively. Cold stratification (28
   days) followed by GA(3) treatments of A. arguta resulted in optimum GP
   of 88% and 23 days optimum MGT at GA(3) concentrations of 1435 and 1610
   ppm, respectively. The same combined treatment of A. chinensis seeds
   yielded optimum GP of 80% and optimum 25 days MGT at GA(3)
   concentrations of 1565 and 2050 ppm, respectively. In contrast, CS (42
   days) followed by GA(3) in A. arguta resulted in optimum GP of 99% and
   27 days optimum MGT at GA(3) concentrations of 1563 and 2120 ppm,
   respectively. Similar treatments in A. chinensis seeds yielded optimum
   GP of 45% and optimum 23 days MGT at GA(3) of 998 and 1629 ppm,
   respectively. In conclusion, CS alone had little effect on germination,
   whereas CS (28 days) followed by GA(3) significantly (p <= 0.05)
   improved GP in both plant species. Treatments with GA(3) alone and CS
   (42 days) followed by GA(3) were more effective on germination of A.
   arguta than A. chinensis. Germinated seeds on moist filter paper can
   produce seedlings when sub-cultured on MS medium for seedling
   development.

AB The expansion of the kiwifruit industry in South Africa has led to
   increasing demand in the new improved species, Actinidia arguta and
   Actinidia chinensis, with smaller and sweeter fruits than the commonly
   grown Actinidia deliciosa. Seed dormancy had been an obstacle in the
   successful seedling establishment of the two Actinidia species thus, the
   effect of gibberellic acid (GA(3)) and cold stratification (CS) on in
   vivo seed germination was studied. In the GA(3) experiment,
   non-stratified seeds were imbibed in dH(2)O (control) and GA(3)
   solutions (500, 1000, 2000 and 2500 ppm) for 24 h at ambient
   temperature. For the CS experiment, seeds of both species were
   stratified on moist filter paper at 4 degrees C for 14, 28, 42 and 56
   days, while seeds kept at ambient temperature served as a control. Seeds
   from different GA(3) and CS treatments were sown in seedling trays
   filled with moistened vermiculite and kept under controlled conditions.
   Data on seedling performance variables, namely, germination percentage
   (GP), mean germination time (MGT), germination rate (GR) and germination
   index (GI) were subjected to ANOVA and then lines of the best fit.
   Imbibing kiwifruit seeds for 24 h in solutions of different GA(3)
   concentrations resulted in no germination of A. arguta seeds and a very
   poor germination (1%) of A. chinensis seeds. In the cold stratified
   seeds, treatment effects were significant (p <= 0.05) in A. chinensis,
   except for A. arguta seeds. In A. chinensis, the optimum CS duration and
   performance values were 37 days and 16% for GP, 34 and 15 days for MGT,
   33 days and 0.04 seedling day(-1) for GR and 39 days and 0.13 seedling
   day(-1) for GI, respectively. Results of this study suggested that GA(3)
   had no positive effect, whereas CS had a promising effect on in vivo
   seed germination in both Actinidia species.

AB Dalbergia cochinchinensis belongs to family Fabaceae, is a hardwood tree
   species listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.
   This species is a slow-growing and it is threatened by overexploitation
   for its timber and illegal logging. Because of the increased demand for
   the timber, the species is rapidly disappearing in many habitats and
   threatened to extinction in the near future. Prevention of illegal
   logging and conservation efforts are required to protect the species.
   Seed germination and seedling growth is a critical step for the abiding
   conservation of plant germplasm. An experiment was to find out
   appropriate pre-sowing treatment for maximizing the germination.
   Eighteen pre-sowing treatments were used for both the seeds sown on
   moist filter paper and soil. Data was collected daily for calculated
   germination percentage, mean germination time, mean germination rate and
   growth performance. Results revealed that hot water treatment was
   effective to increase the germination rate comparison to the control and
   other treatments such as cold treatment and scarification. Significantly
   higher germination percentage (34.4%) and mean germination rate (0.17)
   were recorded in seeds were soaked in hot water 70 degrees C for 1 min
   (T1). Beside, seedling growth such as number of leaves, leaf length and
   seedling height originated from hot water treatment performed
   significantly higher than others. The results indicated that seeds
   treated with hot water had profound and significant impact on seed
   germination and growth of D. cochinchinensis.

AB The reason of poor germination rate of hamabo mallow seed was speculated
   using TZ test to determine the viability of seed. Seeds showed high
   viability via TZ test were not germinated well. The quiescent seeds did
   not imbibed properly due to the hard seed coat and did not show further
   processes required for germination. Several well-known treatments for
   seed coat loosening and water uptake into seed were applied and compared
   for their efficiency. Stratification, hot water treatment, seed coat
   scarification, wet-cold treatment were revealed as less effective for
   improving germination although those treatments were common method for
   breaking dormant seed. Chemical scarification with sulfuric acid,
   however, effectively increased germinability and promptness index of
   hamabo mallow seeds. Optimal time for sulfuric acid treatment was 20
   min. Seeds treated for 20 min showed improved germination percentage,
   germination speed, and promptness index of 80%, 13, and 1969 at 30 days
   after imbibition, respectively, in petri dish experiment. The values
   were greater than control seeds showed low values (12%, 1, and 183,
   respectively). The similar tendency was observed in the pot experiment
   that sulfuric acid treated seed were sown in artificially mixed soil
   (loamy soil:peatmoss:sand:compost = 5:2:2:1) and placed in greenhouse.
   Ultrastructure analysis of chemically scarified seed with sulfuric acid
   for 20 min by scanning electron microscopy did not show any noticeable
   changes in seed coat hardness and water uptake via hilum. But the only
   change after sulfuric acid treatment was removal of hilum cap that close
   the hilum and hider imbibition. Therefore, subsequent experiment was
   conducted to know the relationship between removal of hilum cap and
   facilitated imbibition by sulfuric acid treatment and whether the hilum
   cap removal directly influenced to the opening of micropyle. Water
   uptake velocity of seed treated for 20 min in concentrated sulfuric acid
   for was greater than control seed. This result implies that the crucial
   effect of sulfuric acid treatment is the removal of hilum cap that
   increase water uptake via micropyle in hamabo mallow.
AK 황근 종자가 발아가 잘 안되는 이유를 알아보고자 종자의 활력여부를 확인하기 위해 TZ활력검사를 실시한바, 조직의 활력은 있음이
   판명되었다. 활력이 있는 종자가 발아 안되는 이유를 알기 위하여 종피의 수분 흡수 장해를 검토하였고 그 결과 종피가 딱딱하여
   종자내부로의 물 흡수가 어려운 것을 확인하였다. 물흡수를 원활하게 하기 위해 어떤 조처가 필요한가를 알기 위해 종피약화 및
   발아촉진처리를 몇 가지 실시한 바 층적처리, 열탕처리, 종피파상처리 및 저온습윤처리 등의 방법은 효과가 크게 없었으며 황산처리가
   가장 효과적이었다. 황산처리의 최적시간을 규명하고자 황산처리 시간을 달리하여 먼저 실내에서 발아시험을 실시한 결과 20분 처리가
   치상 30일째 발아율 80% (무처리 12%), 발아속도 13 (무처리 1), 발아속도지수가 1,969 (무처리 183)로 나타나
   발아에 가장 좋았다. 폿트시험에서도 실내시험과 같은 경향을 얻을 수 있었다. 황산20분 처리에서 어떤 이유로 발아가 잘 되는가를
   확인하기 위해서 주사전자현미경(사진)으로 종자조직의 변화를 관찰하였다. 황산20분 처리는 종피약화도 시킬 수 없고 배꼽을 통한
   수분흡수도 불가능 하지만(사진), 황근종자의 배꼽과 주공을 동시에 덮고 있는 hilum cap을 떨어져 나가게 하여 주공을 열수
   있기 때문인 것으로 확신하였다. hilum cap이 떨어져 나가 주공이 열림으로써 수분흡수가 용이한지를 확인하기 위하여
   수분흡수속도를 무처리와 비교하여 시간대별로 조사하였다. 황산20분 처리에서 빠른 속도로 수분 흡수가 이루어짐을 확인할 수 있었다.
   그래서 경실의 황근 종자는 황산20분 침지처리로 배꼽과 주공을 동시에 덮고 있는 hilum cap를 떨어져 나가게 해서 주공을
   열리게 하고 이를 통한 수분흡수가 용이하기 때문에 발아가 잘 되는 것으로 결론지었다.

AB Salvia leriifolia Benth. (Noruozak) is a perennial plant which belongs
   to the Lamiaceae family. This herb has a great importance in the sense
   of pharmaceutical applications. In the nature, seeds of Salvia
   leriifolia hardly germinate endangering its survival. In this work, in
   addition of studying the causes of low germination rate, different
   physic-chemical treatments such as scratching on seed coat, scratch
   seeds under running water, intact seeds under running water, coatless
   seeds, treating intact seed with 98% sulphuric acid for 10 and 15
   minutes were investigated. Seeds were collected from Abkhandari station
   in Sabzevar city in 2009. For sterilization, the solution of HgCl2 0.1%
   w/v was applied for seeds in all of treatments. Also four temperature
   treatments of 4, 20, 25°C and keeping at 4°C for a week then
   transferring to 25°C on germination of seeds were considered. There was
   no seed germination happened in control, mechanical scratching, running
   water and sulphuric acid treatments. The coatless seeds treatment and
   incubation at 4°C for a week and then transferring to 25°C has the most
   effect on seeds germination, with 100% seed germination. According to
   the results, removing the hard and impermeable seed coat of Salvia
   leriifolia as a physical prevention and low temperature as a
   physiological factor were identified as effective method in germination
   of the mentioned species.

AB The present study was carried out to increase loquat seed germination
   with treatments consisting of two soaking temperatures (24 +/- 2 degrees
   C and 38 +/- 2 degrees C), chemical agents [control, 0.5% potassium
   nitrate (KNO3) and 250 mgL(-1) gibberellic acid (GA(3)) each for 20 h],
   and different moist chilling (MC) periods (1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks under 4-5
   degrees C). Compared with 24 +/- 2 degrees C, soaking at 38 +/- 2
   degrees C reduced germination %, mean daily germination (MDG), and mean
   germination time (MGT), plumule and radicle lengths. Germination
   percentage, days to 50% emergence, fresh weight and lateral root numbers
   significantly reduced as MC period increased. KNO3 and GA(3) had no
   significant effect on germination percentage, MDG, MGT and lateral root
   numbers. KNO3 reduced days to 50% emergence and radicle length, but
   increased fresh weight compared with control and GA(3). Finally, our
   results suggest the soaking at 24 +/- 2 degrees C followed by 0.5% KNO3
   each for 20 h plus 1 week of MC or soaking at 24 +/- 2 degrees C
   followed by 250 mgL(-1) GA(3) each for 20 h plus 2 week of MC.

AB Alterations in the redox state of storage proteins and the associated
   proteolytic processes were investigated in moist-chilled and
   warm-incubated walnut (Juglans regia L) kernels prior to germination.
   The kernel total protein labeling with a thiol-specific fluorochrome
   i.e. monobromobimane (mBBr) revealed more reduction of 29-32 kDa
   putative glutelins, while in the soluble proteins, both putative
   glutelins and 41, 55 and 58 kDa globulins contained reduced disulfide
   bonds during mobilization. Thus, the in vivo more reduced disulfide
   bonds of storage proteins corresponds to greater solubility. After the
   in vitro reduction of walnut kernel proteins pre-treated by N-ethyl
   maleimide (NEM) with dithioerythrethiol (DTT) and bacterial thioredoxin,
   the 58 kDa putative globulin and a 6 kDa putative albumin were
   identified as disulfide proteins. Thioredoxin stimulated the reduction
   of the H2O2-oxidized 6 kDa polypeptide, but not the 58 kDa polypeptide
   by DTT. The solubility of 6 kDa putative albumin, 58 and 19-24 kDa
   putative globulins and glutelins, respectively, were increased by DTT.
   The in vitro specific mobilization of the 58 kDa polypeptide that
   occurred at pH 5.0 by the kernel endogenous protease was sensitive to
   the serine-protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and
   stimulated by DTT. The specific degradation of the 58 kDa polypeptide
   might be achieved through thioredoxin-mediated activation of a serine
   protease and/or reductive unfolding of its 58 kDa polypeptide substrate.
   As redox changes in storage proteins occurred equally in both moist
   chilled and warm incubated walnut kernels, the regulatory functions of
   thioredoxins in promoting seed germination may be due to other
   germination related processes. (C) 2012 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

AB Seed dormancy is one of the major problems in agricultural studies,
   especially for medical plants. Anise (Pimpinella anisum L.) is an
   important medical plant with dormant seed and it is established and
   distributed only in its natural habitats. In order to evaluate the
   effects of some pretreatment factors on primary growth and germination
   characteristics of Anise, an experiment was conducted as Factorial
   layout within completely randomized design with four replications.
   Pre-chilling treatments were 0, 15, 30 and 45 days treatments and
   hormone treatments were GA3 (Gibberellic Acid), BA (Benzyladenine), KI
   (Kinetin), GA3+BA, GA3+KI, BA+KI, GA3+BA+KI, KNO3, H2SO4 and distilled
   water as a control treatment. Prechilling treatment effects on
   coleoptile and radicle length, seedling length, germination percentage,
   mean time for germination, germination rate and seed vigor index were
   meaningful. Different hormone treatments had significant influence on
   coleoptile and radicle length, seedling length, germination percentage,
   mean time germination, germination rate and seed vigor index. The
   highest germination percentage and germination rate was related to usage
   of BA+KI. The higher values for radicle length and uniformity of seed
   germination were achieved in application of BA and KI, respectively.
   Moreover, application of GA3+BA+KI had obtained the highest seed vigor
   index. It seems that application of endogenous GA3+KI and BA+KI
   concentration, which is provided mostly by chilling treatment, is the
   most effective factor for breaking the seed dormancy. On the basis of
   the results, usage of 45 days moist prechilling accompanied with
   application of GA3+KI and BA+KI in Esfahan cultivar was appropriate.

AB To study the effect of different treatments on dormancy breaking of
   Avena fatua eight experiments based on randomized complete design (RCD)
   with five replications were conducted in the Arsanjan Islamic Azad
   University, Fars province. Dormancy breaking treatments included the
   application of different concentrations of gibberellin, sulfuric acid,
   warm water, stratification (chilling), scarification, different
   temperatures, rinsing, and the use of ethanol. The results showed that
   the highest percentage of germination was found in the stratification
   period of 2 to 3 weeks at 2-5°C in which germination rate was over 70%.
   Gibberellin application with a concentration of 600 ppm led to wild oat
   braking dormancy with the maximum seed germination of 36%. The wild oat
   seeds exposure to sulfuric acid also led to dormancy breaking where the
   highest germination of 36% was obtained by a 8-hour seed exposure. The
   results of concentration of sulfuric acid showed that the highest seed
   germination was 42% in treatment via concentration sulfuric acid 15%. In
   addition, our findings indicated that rinsing, warm water application,
   constant temperatures were not effective treatment for wild oat dormancy
   breaking.

AB Iranian mountain ash (Sorbus persica Hedl.) is a valuable shrub species
   which also frequently occurs in the stands located in Isfahan province
   in central Zagros. Mountain ash seedling typically begins to germinate
   after winter. We investigated its seed germination by means of a
   completely randomized design with 15 treatments including the pre-chill,
   warm stratification then pre-chill, gibberellin, gibberellin then
   pre-chill, and control treatments, each in four replications. The
   highest germination rate (97.50%) was observed for two-week warm
   stratification (25°C) and the 4-month cold stratification (1-4°C)
   treatments. The success of cold stratification treatment suggests that
   Iranian mountain ash is associated with physiological dormancy. Since
   the prechilled treatment for 120 days at 1-4°C completely broke the seed
   dormancy, the seed dormancy was concluded to be substantially deep.
   Reducing the initial seed moisture content (17.3%) to 7% did not affect
   its survival. Moreover, seed viability was maintained following a
   600-day storage at -20°C, suggesting an orthodox behavior of the seeds.
   In conclusion, the use of appropriate treatment resulted in a very high
   germination rate.

AB Apiaceae plants are one of the most important plant families due to high
   medicinal and economic importance. Existence seed dormancy in this
   family is one of major obstacles for cultivation and domestication of
   them. This research was performed to determine the best treatment for
   breaking seed dormancy and improve germination four key medicinal
   species seeds of apiaceae family including Ferula assafoetida, Ferula
   gummosa, Kelussia odoratissma and Carum carvi L. For each specie has
   been studied 14 treatment including control, prechilling for 10, 20, 30,
   40, 50, 70, 90 days, gibberellic acid 200, 400, 600, 800 ppm, integrated
   treatment gibberellic acid 400 ppm with cold 30 and 70 days in a
   completely randomized design with four replications. The results showed
   that four species found significant differences compared to the control
   by increasing time of cold, density of gibberellic acid, germination
   percent, germination rate, radicle length, plumule length and seed
   vigor. Integrated treatment cold 70 days with gibberellic acid 400 ppm
   were the best treatment for breaking seeds dormancy of Ferula
   assafoetida (88%), Ferula gummosa (95%), Kelussia odoratissa (87%), also
   cold treatment 90 days, the best treatment for breaking seeds dormancy
   Carum carvi L. (87%). According to the results, gibberellic acid
   treatment could be replaced part of cold needs for breaking seed
   dormancy, however, it is possible, four species seeds have physiological

AB Seed coat color as a perfect and simple index is effective on water
   absorption, seed dormancy and germination. Mustard plant produces seeds
   with different coat color. So, in order to investigate the effect of
   seed coat color on germination rate, percentage of germination and
   dormancy of Mustard (Sinapis arvensis L.) seeds an experiment was
   carried out based on completely randomized design with four
   replications. Treatments were included two types of seed coat color
   (brown and black) and dormancy breaking treatments (Control, Potassium
   nitrate 0.2%, GA3 250, GA3 500 ppm and one, two and three weeks
   prechilling). The results showed that the differences between
   germination indices traits in brown and black seeds were significant. So
   that, the germination rate and germination percent in black seed were
   greater than brown seeds, but duration of dormancy in brown seeds was
   greater than black seed. One week prechilling treatment had most effect
   on breaking dormancy. So that germination percentage and germination
   rate for black seed was 75% and 0.54 respectively and these amounts for
   brown seeds were 58% and 0/43 respectively. Potassium nitrate and GA3
   (250 and 500 ppm) reduced germination rate and germination percent in
   both types of seeds. In addition, water absorption percent in brown
   seeds was more than black seeds. The final results showed that
   heteromorphic seeds of Mustard have variation in duration of dormancy,
   germination and water absorption percent.

AB Osmotic stress is one of the major environmental stresses that limits
   plant growth and seed germination in many areas of the world. The
   purpose of this research was to determine the degree and range of
   tolerance to osmotic stress in 20 wheatgrass ecotypes to identify
   ecotypes that might be potentially useful in arid and semiarid regions.
   We used a completely randomized factorial design with two factors, five
   levels of osmotic stress (0, -0.2, -0.5, -0.8, and -1.6 MPa), wheatgrass
   ecotypes, and three replicates. Our findings suggest that AD1, AD2, AD3,
   and AD5 ecotypes under osmotic stress have a higher level of final
   germination percentage (FGP) and rate of germination (GR), although they
   had a lower value for the average germination time (MGT) than other
   ecotypes during the experiment. These results suggested that AD1, AD2,
   AD3, AD5, AE5, AC6, and FA ecotypes exhibited a more effective
   protection, along with various mechanisms, and the mitigation of
   oxidative damages such as lipid peroxidation through mechanisms by which
   enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant activities were maintained at a
   higher level. Also, these ecotypes showed higher proline and total
   nonstructural carbohydrate contents (TNC), but lower malondialdehyde
   content (MDA) and H2O2 content than other ecotypes. A cluster analysis
   found these same six ecotypes (AD1, AD2, AD3, AD5, AE5, and AC6) and FA
   were clustered into a group of "osmotic-tolerant ecotypes". This group
   might be potentially useful in arid and semiarid regions.

AB The factors affecting seed dormancy and germination characteristics of
   Sorbus pohuashanensis were studied. The factors include the
   morphological development of embryos, the mechanical breaking of the
   seed coat, the water and air permeability of seed coat, and the
   biological inhibition of extracts from different parts of the seed. The
   results showed that when the seeds of S. pohuashanensis were mature, the
   morphological development of the embryos was complete. The effect of the
   mechanical obstruction, the water and permeability of seed coat to seed
   germination was small. There were inhibited substances in the seed coat
   and embryo which could be fat soluble substances. This indicated that
   the degree of dormancy was different for the different embryo parts.
   Cotyledon and hypocotyl was in low degree of dormancy, whereas radicle
   and epicotyl was in high degree of dormancy. To some extent, the
   germination rate of in vitro cultured embryos was increased with
   detruncating cotyledon and radicle treatment. A 1:3 mixture of seeds and
   sand at low temperature were favourable for breaking dormancy. Treated
   by 200 mg/l 6-BA for 24 h, then remained in low temperature (0-5°C),
   seeds could germinate well (the germination rate could reach 31.56% in 3
   months treatment). ABA completely inhibited the germination of seed,
   warm-cold temperature treatment did not promote the dormancy breaking of
   the seed.

AB Objective: The effects of low temperature on the germination indexes of
   different watermelon materials were studied, and the low temperature
   tolerant germplasm materials were screened to provide theoretical
   reference for the breeding of low temperature tolerant watermelon
   varieties. Methods: Thirty-nine watermelon varieties(lines)and
   combinations were used as experimental materials, and a few incubators
   were used to simulate different low temperature stresses(15/10°C, 15°C
   and 17°C). The effects of low temperature stress on germination
   potential, germination rate, radicle length, vigor index, chilling
   injury index and recovery ability of watermelon seeds were analyzed,
   furthermore, and the low temperature tolerance of different watermelon
   materials was evaluated by pole-sorting method. Results: Germination
   potential, relative germination rate, relative radicle length and
   relative vigor index were decreased under low temperature stress, and
   the inhibition was more obvious with the decrease of stress temperature.
   The germination potential, relative germination rate, relative radicle
   length and relative vigor index of watermelon seeds were significantly
   correlated with the comprehensive evaluation score of low temperature
   tolerance, and the relative vigor index and the evaluation scores
   exhibited the highest correlation(r=0.949). Different watermelon
   materials had different tolerance to low temperature during
   germination.At 17°C, there were significant differences in germination
   potential, relative germination rate, relative radicle length and
   relative vigor index among different watermelon materials. The four
   indexes and chilling injury index were selected and the comprehensive
   evaluation score of each watermelon material was obtained by using the
   pole sorting method. The results showed that the comprehensive
   evaluation score of 170-1 was higher than 5, which was a low temperature
   resistant material. The comprehensive score of Qianli 4, Sumi 1667,
   Qianli 1, reciprocals of Qianli 4, Qianmei 1, 135-2, 161-5,
   17A-81*17A-82 were lower than 2, which were low temperature sensitive
   materials, anothers were medium low temperature resistant materials.
   Conclusion: Low temperature inhibited the germination of watermelon
   seeds, 17°C could be used as the suitable temperature for identification
   of low temperature tolerance of different watermelon materials at
   germination stage, watermelon materials with different low temperature
   tolerance could provide experimental materials for breeding of low
   temperature tolerant varieties and basic theoretical research.

   C resulted in seedling growth retardation at room temperature but the
   heat shock was ameliorated by chilling treatment since in all
   experimentals (treatments at 35, 40, 45 and 50 degrees C) seedlings
   exhibited uniform proliferated growth in cold condition. This quality of

AB Objective: In order to prove whether Allium galanthum L. has
   imbibitional chilling injury and whether PEG has osmotic. Method:
   conditioning on the seeds germination when imbibed at low temperature.
   Result: The study tests the relative electric conductivity, germination
   rate, germination index and vigor index of Allium galanthum seeds
   germinated for 1 d, 2 d, 3 d, 5 d and 7 d at 5°C imbibitional experiment
   and treated with different PEG concentrations of 0%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%
   and 30% respectively. After analysis of variance the results show that
   Allium galanthum L. has imbibitional chilling when imbibed at 5°C.
   Conclusion: The germination is inhibited when the treatment time is
   longer than 2 days. The germination can be improved significantly when
   treated with PEG at the same condition, and the suitable PEG
   concentration which control the seed germination increased with the
   extending of time of the low temperature treatment.

   scarification, chemical treatments with KNO3 and/or GA3, and low
   temperature treatments) on dormancy and germination. The seed coat had
   good water permeability, and made up 88-94% of the weight of the whole
   seed. The germination rate could reach at 40.06% after the seeds had
   been treated with sulfuric acid for 2 days, and then with 500 mg/litre
   GA3, followed by stratification outdoors at low temperature over the
   winter. Untreated seeds did not germinate. The type of seed dormancy
   exhibited by Sinojackia xylocarpa is termed comprehensive, since it

AB The seed of Stewartia is extremely expensive and seeds can be sown
   immediately after in fall and well germinate in two years. Korean native
   stewartia has been well appreciated by the public for landscapes.
   However, it has remained unavailable due to difficulties in asexual
   propagation. The objectives of this study were the determination of
   effectiveness of various treatments for seed germination and the best
   time for softwood cuttings for suitable propagation of Stewartia
   koreana. The results obtained were as follows. Seeds are generally
   doubly dormant and should be collected before the capsules split in
   October. Stored seeds lose their viability quickly and should be placed
   in pretreatment immediately. After treatment of GA 3000 ppm for 24 hours
   under 25 degree C incubator in dark condition, warm stratification for 3
   months followed by cold stratification for 3 months satisfied the
   requirements for germination. The germination rate was 42%. Studies were
   conducted on effects of IBA concentration and the season of the softwood
   cuttings. Softwood cuttings with 3000 ppm IBA on June 12 resulted in
   best rooting of 90%. Rooting of cuttings taken in late July declined to
   40% for softwood cuttings.

   basal nitrogen was increased. Therefore, it is evidenced that the change
   of nitrogen application amount may influence the number of seedling
   stand. Growth characteristics of G. littoralis such as root length, root
   diameter and yield were good in 150kg/ha nitrogen fertilization and the
   best in 30 - 40 - 30% nitrogen split applications.

AB Three germination attributes (lag time, maximum germination rate, and
   final germination proportion) were measured for 64 species of herbaceous
   wetland plants.  The environmental conditions approximated the drawdown
   environment known to stimulate germination in wetland plants:  a period
   of cold stratification followed by position of the seed on the surface
   of wet, but not inundated, substrate in the presence of light and with a
   20/30-degrees-C daily temperature cycle.  Correlations were sought
   between the three germination attributes and average individual seed
   weight, seedling relative growth rate and a categorical variable
   indicating miminum time to reproduction (annuals, facultative annuals
   and obligate perennials).  Average seed weight was not correlated with
   any of the three germination attributes.  Seedling relative growth rate
   was negatively correlated with time to initiation of germination. 
   Species capable of setting seed their first year (annuals and
   facultative annuals) initiated germination sooner, a larger proportion
   germinated per day once germination began, and a larger proportion of
   seeds had germinated by the end of the experiment in comparison with
   species which require more than 1 year to set seed (obligate
   perennials).  A discriminant analysis showed that the time to initiation
   of germination could accurately classify 89% of the perennial species as
   being either facultative annuals or obligate perennials.

   by the percentage of germination (%G), mean germination time (TMG) and
   germination velocity index (IVG). Seedlings were also analyzed for
   aerial length (CPA), root (CR) and total dry biomass (BST) at 14 days
   after sowing. The highest %G (48.61%) was obtained by applying 3.19 dS
   m-1. The smallest TMG (9.64 days) was obtained using germitest paper,
   while the sand had a higher TMG of 14.10%. The highest IVG (1.31) was
   obtained using sand at the level of 3.01 dS m-1. The maximum CPA (22.52
   mm) was obtained at the level of 2.96 dS m-1. The CR presented a
   decrease from the conductivity of 2.56 dS m-1. Malagueta pepper seeds

AB The ecophysiology of germination in Pinus brutia and P. halepensis was
   studied in seeds collected from different areas of Greece. In regard to
   the temperature range of germination, both P. halepensis and the
   southern provenance (Lasithi, Crete) of the East Mediterranean pine, P.
   brutia, follow a typical Mediterranean pattern. In the latter species,
   dramatic differences in the degree of dormancy were noted among the
   three provenances investigated; in all seed lots however, 20 degrees C
   was clearly the optimal temperature for germination. Stratification
   resulted in a considerable promotion of P. brutia seed germination.
   Nevertheless, the inductive effect of stratification was shown to differ
   among the three provenances used, escalating from a simple increase of
   germination rate (in the southern seed lot from Lasithi, Crete) through
   a broadening of the temperature range of germination (in the
   intermediate lot from Thasos Island) to, finally, a dramatic release
   from a particularly deep dormancy (in the northern lot from Soufli).
   These deeply dormant seeds of the latter provenance displayed an
   absolute stratification requirement; prolonged illumination or seed coat
   scarification could not substitute for the promotive effect of
   prechilling. A considerable interaction between far-red light and
   stratification was revealed in the dormant seeds of P. brutia (Soufli
   provenance); far-red pulses during stratification could either cancel or
   diminish the germination promotion induced by low temperatures. The
   differences observed in the germination behaviour among the various P.
   brutia provenances may be attributed to a variable ecophysiological
   strategy in regard to the temporal pattern of seedling emergence and
   establishment. According to the variants of this strategy, seed
   germination is timed to occur during either spring (in regions with
   relatively cold and moist climates), or autumn and early winter (in
   southern, mild and dry areas) or both (in intermediate conditions).

   Gryshko National Botanical Garden of the National Academy of Sciences of
   Ukraine (NBG) are discussed. The study was carried out in 2016-2018 on
   experimental fields and in the NBG laboratory using plants and seeds of
   Ukrainian selection S. chinensis 'Sadovyi-1'. Sections were examined
   with the microscope Carl Zeiss STEMI 2000-S. Qualitative and
   quantitative composition of higher fatty acids has been identified by
   HP-6890 chromatograph. It was found that S. chinensis of local
   reproduction have a much lower percentage of the seeds without embryo
   (about 10%) compared to those of natural origin (30-90%). Because of
   long-term storage of S. chinensis seeds the biochemical transformations
   take place: the content of fats and proteins decreased from 37.5 to
   28.0%, and from 19.7 to 11.2%, respectively, the acid number of oil
   increased from 2.42 to 5.70 mg KOH/g, and its iodine value decreased
   from 32.5 to 30.3 g I2/100 g after storage of seeds during ten months.
   Fatty oil of S. chinensis seeds has a high linoleic acid content, which
   reaches 80-81.1% of the total content of fatty acids. The storage of
   seeds under different illumination and temperature conditions resulted
   in minor changes in the acid number of the oil and the quantitative
   content of fatty acids. The optimal storage conditions of seeds (without
   access to light and at the temperature of +4°C) were determined. Such
   storage conditions reduce the intensity of oxidative processes in the
   seeds, ensuring the highest germination rate. The optimal ways of S.
   chinensis reproduction by seeds are the spring sowing of stratified
   seeds and autumn sowing of freshly reaped seeds, which gain natural
   stratification. Using these ways resulted in 65% and 63% of seeds
   germination, respectively.

AB The results are reported from an experiment on the effects of cutting
   date (14 June, 21 July and 1 September), fertilizer application (none or
   80 kg ha(-1) N plus 40 kg ha(-1) P and K) and grazing treat ments (none,
   autumn or autumn plus spring) on the vegetation of an upland mesotrophic
   grassland in Upper Teesdale, northern England, UK.
   Effects on plant species number and cover Ne reported for 4 years
   (1989-93) of treatment. Effects on 'species-attributes' are given for
   the fourth year.
   The cessation of grazing combined with the use of fertilizer
   progressively reduced species number by about 25%. Under traditional
   management (no fertilizer, cutting date on 21 July, autumn and spring
   grazing) the species number and cover remained relatively static over
   the 4 years.
   Comparison between treatments in the fourth year showed a reduction in
   species number under the fertilizer application, cutting date on 1
   September and no-grazing treatments. Fertilizer use together with
   cutting date on 1 September particularly lowered species number and
   cover,
   Analysis of variance was used to assess the effect of treatment on
   species that occurred frequently in the sward. A cutting date of 1
   September favoured Agrostis capillaris, Alopecurus pratensis, Poa
   trivialis, Phleum pratense and Trisetum flavescens. The absence of
   grazing favoured Dactylis glomerata and Holcus lanatus. The use of
   fertilizer particularly favoured A, pratensis and H, lanatus. Ordination
   methods were used to assess. the effect of treatment on the less
   frequent species. These were primarily associated with the treatment
   combination that matched 'traditional' management. Deviations from this
   'traditional' regime acted separately, rather than in combination, and
   favoured different grass species. Traditional management was associated
   with ruderal, stress-tolerant ruderal and competitive ruderal
   strategists and with longer seed germination times, heavier seeds, some
   of which needed scarifying or chilling to break dormancy, and transient
   seed banks that germinated in the autumn.
   The original sward was an Anthoxanthum odoratum-Geranium sylvaticum
   grassland, Briza media subcommunity (MG3b). After 4 years, Festuca
   ovina-Agrostis capillaris-Galium saxatile grassland, Holcus
   lanatus-Trifolium repens subcommunity (U4b) and Lolium
   perenne-Alopecurus pratensis-Festuca pratensis grassland (MG7c) were
   round in many of the fertilized and late-cutting treatments.

AB Temperatures between 10 degrees C and 25 degrees C limit seedling growth
   and reversibly inhibit net assimilation (A(N)) in cold sensitive plants.
   Because A(N) represents multiple component processes operating in a
   highly concerted manner, quantifying the cold sensitivities of each
   constituent would provide targets for improving cold tolerance. To
   address this, Gossypium hirsutum (cotton) seedlings grown under
   sub-optimal temperatures (20/15 degrees C) exhibited substantial
   declines in plant growth, A(N), and nearly every thylakoid process
   assessed, relative to optimal conditions (30/20 degrees C). In contrast,
   energy dissipation by photosystem II (PSII) increased under low
   temperature concomitant with a rise in carotenoid content, hydrogen
   peroxide production, and ascorbate peroxidase activity. Temperature
   response experiments defined the temperature needed for 50% reductions
   in activity for a given process (T-50). Respiration (R-D) was the most
   cold-sensitive process followed by thylakoid-dependent processes and
   gross photosynthesis (A(G)), whereas A(N) was the most-cold tolerant
   process evaluated. A(N)-C-i experiments revealed that carboxylation was
   more cold-sensitive than RuBP regeneration. Maximum quantum yield of
   photosystem II was insensitive to low incubation temperature (F-v/F-m),
   and T-50 could not be estimated. Low temperature-grown plants also
   exhibited a 1.5 degrees C increase in T-50 for R-D, a 2.5 degrees C
   decrease in T-50 for thylakoid-dependent processes and A(G), and a 3.4
   degrees C decrease in T-50 for A(N). Thus, the current study defines the
   relative cold sensitivities of the underlying processes driving A(N).
   Additionally, it is concluded that A(N) acclimates to low growth
   temperature more than any other process evaluated due to increased cold
   sensitivity of R-D and increased cold tolerance of thylakoid dependent
   processes and A(G).

AB Seed viability is affected by storage conditions, and rapid loss of
   viability in storage is the major cause for low germination. This study
   was carried out to examine the effect of packaging materials and storage
   temperature on seed germination rate over 10 years in two species:
   (Capsicum annuum L. and Brassica rapa L. ssp. pekinensis) and determine
   effective storage conditions for maintaining seed viability. Seeds were
   packaged in aluminum poly pouches under vacuum, polyethylene bottles,
   and paper bags containing silica gel and stored under one of two
   controlled conditions (15 degrees C, RH 40% or 5 degrees C, RH 30%) or
   at ambient condition. Seed germination was recorded at 6-month intervals
   for 10 years. The seeds of both species showed no decline in viability
   until 6.5 years at 15 or 5 degrees C, irrespective of Packaging
   materials. However, under ambient conditions, the seeds of chili pepper
   and Chinese cabbage in paper bags lost viability after 4 and 5 years
   respectively. By contrast, seeds of both species, in vacuum-aluminum
   poly pouches exhibited a 99% germination rate after 6 years under
   ambient conditions. Pepper seeds in the vacuum-aluminum poly pouches
   maintained a 93% germination rate after 10 years in ambient conditions.
   These results indicated that a special, seed storage facility for
   maintaining viability of chili pepper and Chinese cabbage seed might hot
   be essential and seed testing would not be necessary for 10 years if
   chili pepper and Chinese cabbage seeds were packed in
   ambient/vacuum-aluminum poly pouches or 5 degrees C/vacuum-aluminum poly
   pouches.

AB Given that the ecological niche of tree species is typically narrower
   for earlier life stages, intraspecific genetic variation at early
   fitness traits may greatly influence the adaptive response of tree
   populations to changing environmental conditions. In this study, we
   evaluated genetic variation in early fitness traits among 12 populations
   of Betula pendula from a wide latitudinal range in Europe (41-55 degrees
   N). We first conducted a chamber experiment to test for population
   differences in germination and the effect of pre-chilling treatment on
   seed dormancy release. We then established three common gardens spread
   across the species latitudinal range in order to evaluate levels of
   quantitative genetic variation and genotype-by-environment interaction
   at different early life traits. Our results showed significant variation
   in chamber germination rates among populations (0-60 %), with southern
   populations exhibiting lower germination. Pre-chilling treatments did
   not generally improve germination success. Population seedling emergence
   rates in the field were correlated with chamber germination rates,
   though being an order of magnitude lower, with an average ranging from 0
   to 1.3 % across gardens. Highly significant variation was found in field
   emergence rates among populations, and between seed-crop years within
   populations, but not among families within populations. Populations
   differed in seedling height, diameter, slenderness and budburst date,
   with significant among-family variation. Population latitude was
   positively associated with chamber germination rate and with seedling
   emergence rate in one of the central field sites. Overall, genetic,
   environmental and demographic factors seem to influence the observed
   high levels of variation in early fitness traits among B. pendula
   populations. Our results suggest limited regeneration capacity for the
   study species under drier conditions, but further field trials with
   sufficient replication over environments and seed crops will improve our
   understanding of its vulnerability to climate change.

AB The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of seed maturation
   on germination, growth and seedling quality index of common ash
   (Fraxinus excelsior L.) in Kelardasht forest nursery. In 2017, the seeds
   of immature in late August and the seeds of mature in late November were
   collected and following stratification in moist sand were sown in
   nursery bed in mid-Feberaury each with three 100- replications. From the
   mature seeds, some of them germinated in 2nd year (April 2018) and the
   seed germination, biomass and quality indices of their seedlings were
   statistically (paired t-test) compared with the results of immature
   seeds germinated in spring 2017. The highest percentage of cumulative
   germination allocated to the immature seeds, followed by mature seeds
   germinated in 2nd year. Due to the lack of germination of most of the
   mature seeds in spring 2017, showed the seed dormancy, their germination
   traits were not considered in the statistical test. Germination
   percentage, mean germination time and germination speed and also, dry
   biomass, root biomass, root length and seedling quality index in
   immature seeds were greater than those in mature seeds germinated in
   second year. Generally, it is best to collect the seedlings of immature
   seed in order to achieve the optimum germination and growth, because the
   mature seeds are often dormant and unable to germinate during the first
   growing season. If mature seeds are supplied, it is advisable that these
   seeds to be stratified until spring of the second year.

AB This thesis aims to determine the approaches for the improvement of seed
   germination of oriental beech (Fagus orientalis), a timber-producing
   species in the Hyrcanian forests in northern Iran. Germination behaviour
   of beechnuts was enhanced either by decreasing the dormancy breakage
   period, or by increasing seedlot quality. A dormant seedlot was stored
   in sub-chilling conditions for 15 months and a series of germination
   tests was conducted during the dormancy breaking period of stored and
   fresh nuts. Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) combined with partial
   least squares (PLS) regression were also used as rapid and
   nondestructive methods for discrimination of sound and deteriorated
   single beech nuts. It was observed that a simple grading based on the
   weight of beech nuts, before exposing the dormant nuts to dormancy
   breaking conditions, significantly increased the germination capacity of
   heavy class beech nuts and reduced the period of dormancy breaking.
   Almost the same results were obtained by removing the endocarp. Applying
   alternative chilling temperatures during dormancy breaking had positive
   effects on speed of dormancy release. Results on the seedlots showed
   that the mean germination times for both nut groups were almost the same
   but germination capacity was statistically different only for
   semi-dormant nuts. Non-dormant stored and fresh nuts showed no
   significant differences which indicate the complexity of dormancy
   release in oriental beech nuts. Abscisic acid (ABA) contents of
   embryonic axes of stored and fresh nuts were measured during the
   dormancy breaking period and results indicate a close correlation
   between ABA levels and increment in germination capacity as dormancy was
   released. NIRS and PLS methods, on the other hand, showed a 100%
   accuracy in separation of viable and non-viable nuts. These simple
   methods can be used with little equipment in forest nurseries and are
   suggested to be accompanied with more advanced techniques like
   restricting moisture content during moist cold stratification period to
   gain maximum benefits. Four related papers are appended.

AB It takes 10-11 months for Plagiorhegma dubia Maxim. seeds to germinate
   under natural conditions with low germination rate. In order to improve
   the germination rate of P. dubia seeds and obtain seedlings, the
   dormancy types of P. dubia seeds and the methods of breaking dormancy
   quickly were studied by morphological anatomy, extraction of inhibitory
   substances and stratification treatment after immersion with GA3. There
   were linear embryos in the seeds and the seeds contained
   germination-inhibiting substances. Seed dormancy is mainly caused by
   immature seed embryo and germination-inhibiting substance in seeds.
   After soaking the seed with gibberellin, stratification treatment could
   break the dormancy of the seed and promote the germination and rooting
   of the seed obviously. The best treatment method was as follows: after
   soaking the seed with gibberellin concentration of 500 mg.L-1 for 48 h,
   the seed was stored in the 20°C environment for 30 d, and then
   transferred to the 10°C environment for 90 d. The germination rate was
   up to 31.11%, and the seed coat cracking rate was up to 80.00%. Compared
   with natural environment germination, this method could shorten the
   germination time by 5 months.

AB Seed germination is the initial stage of crop morphology, which is
   determined by its own properties and environmental factors. Low
   temperature is one of the most important factors affecting seed
   germination. It is crucial to explore the relationship between seed
   properties and germination under low temperature environmental
   conditions for maize production in Northeast China. In the present
   study, 36 maize hybrids released in Northeast China were selected and
   the germination culture experiment was conducted under 6°C (low
   temperature stress) and 15°C (the control). The seedling vigor, seed
   germination rate, seed morphology and storage substances content were
   determined. The germination potential and germination rate of 36 maize
   hybrids were evaluated by the principal component analysis (PCA), the
   comprehensive evaluation value of cold tolerance (CL-value), and the
   membership function value (R-value). The relationship between the seed
   morphology (kernel length, kernel width, kernel thickness, kernel
   length/kernel width ratio, 100-kernel volume, and 100-kernel weight) and
   the seed storage substances (starch, protein, and fat) of 36 maize
   varieties were investigated. The results showed that the seedling vigor
   and germination rate of 36 maize hybrids were inhibited to some content,
   and the variation of relative seedling vigor cold injury rate and
   relative germination cold injury rate was the largest under low
   temperature stress. There was a significant correlation among the seven
   individual indicators that characterized cold tolerance. Principal
   component analysis could transform seven individual indicators into two
   independent comprehensive indicators. Among them, relative seedling
   vigor and relative germination rate had the largest positive
   contribution rate, which could be used as the key indicators for cold
   resistance evaluation at germination stage in maize. We classified 36
   hybrids into four types of strong cold tolerance (19.4%), cold tolerance
   (30.6%), medium cold tolerance (33.3%), and cold sensitive (16.7%) by
   cluster analysis. Among them, Jidan 56, Kenji 267, Suiyu 23, Jidan 953,
   Kenji 268, Jidan 96, and Jidan 95 were strong cold-tolerant hybrids. The
   correlation analysis revealed that there was no significant correlation
   between seed morphology and cold tolerance. Starch content was
   significantly correlated with relative seedling vigor, relative
   germination rate, relative seedling vigor chilling injury rate, relative
   germination chilling injury rate, and relative germination time (r =
   0.396**, r = 0.404 **, r = -0.401 **, r = -0.391 **, and r = 0.362 **).
   There was a significant negative correlation between protein content and
   relative seedling vigor (r = -0.379**). Regression analysis indicated
   that the types with high starch content had higher relative seedling
   vigor, relative germination rate, relative germination time, and lower
   relative seedling vigor, relative germination rate, and chilling injury
   rate. The regression model demonstrated that the seed starch content was
   72.0%-74.0%, the relative seedling vigor was ≥70.0%, the relative
   germination rate was ≥80.5%, and the chilling injury rate of relative
   seedling vigor and relative germination rate was ≤50.0% under 6°C
   stress. Under low temperature stress, the higher seed starch content was
   helpful to improve seed germination and reduce chilling injury. The
   varieties with starch content of 72.0%-74.0% were recommended to meet
   the requirements of seed germination in Northeast China.

   pusanensis, V. rotunda var. subintegra, V. nakaiana, V. pyrethrina, and
   V. kiusiana var. glabrifolia) were evaluated, and seed dormancy types
   (kinds) were classified. Among the study species, V. kiusiana var.
   diamantiaca has been designated as both an endemic and rare species
   (critically endangered) in Korea. The seeds were incubated at constant
   temperatures of 4, 15, 20, 25, and 30 degrees C for 30 days, and
   germination percentage and mean germination time were calculated. Embryo
   morphology was observed in initial seed and at seed coat split. The
   optimum germination temperatures of eight Veronica species seeds were
   approximately 20 to 25 degrees C, considering final germination
   percentage (FGP) and mean germination time (MGT) together. All seeds of
   Veronica species germinated to more than 90% at five temperature regimes
   for 30 days except V. rotunda (66.1%) and V. kiusiana var. diamantiaca
   (47.6%). The seeds of eight Veronica species had underdeveloped embryos
   that occupied 0.46 to 0.61 of the seed length at dispersal, and the
   embryo length increased by 18.8 to 58.0% of their initial length. To
   improve the germination of V. kiusiana var. diamantiaca seeds, we
   treated the seeds with different periods of cold stratification (0, 3,
   and 6 weeks at 4 degrees C) and gibberellic acid (GA(3)) soaking (0, 50,
   100, and 1,000 mg.L-1). FGP of V. kiusiana var. diamantiaca seeds with
   the cold stratification period of 0, 3, and 6 weeks was 45.0, 75.3, and
   80.3%, respectively. FGP of V. kiusiana var. diamantiaca seeds treated

   V. rotunda var. subintegra, V. nakaiana, V. pyrethrina, and V. kiusiana
   var. glabrifolia had morphological dormancy (MD). The seeds of V rotunda
   had 66% MD, whereas the seeds of V. kiusiana var. diamantiaca had 48% MD
   and about 44% morphophysiological dormancy (MPD). There were different
   kinds of dormancy (MD and MPD) within the eight Veronica species
   examined; thus, we found that there is an interspecific variation in
   dormancy breaking and germination requirements in the genus. This is the
   first report that classified seed dormancy types in Veronica species
   native to the Korean peninsula, and the results could be useful to study
   the morphological seed dormancy and ecophysiological mechanism of the
   genus Veronica.

AB Primary physiological dormancy and secondary physiological dormancy of
   Korean pine seeds restrict the regeneration of broad-leaved Korean pine
   (Pinus koraiensis) mixed forest. Dry and imbibed seeds were stratified
   at 1 degrees C and 5 degrees C for 1, 2, 4 and 6 months. Germination
   percentage, mean germination time (MGT) and germination rate index (GRI)
   were measured to determine the optimal low temperature and its duration
   for the release of primary physiological dormancy. Once primary
   physiological dormancy was released through cold stratification, seeds
   were stored in an environment in which the temperature progressively
   increased from 5 to 25 degrees C. After one month of storage at each
   storage temperature, the germination percentage, MGT and GRI were
   measured to determine the threshold temperature for the induction of
   secondary physiological dormancy. Both dry and imbibed seeds not only
   exhibited a high germination percentage (approximately 80%) but also
   germinated rapidly (MGT and GRI were 17 days and 2.36, respectively)
   after 6 months of storage at either 1 degrees C or 5 degrees C. The
   germination percentage of cold stratified seeds gradually decreased from
   78% (5 degrees C) to 72% (10 degrees C), 55% (15 degrees C), 10% (20
   degrees C) and 8% (25 degrees C). The results of this study suggest that
   stratifying seeds at 1 degrees C or 5 degrees C for 6 months releases
   primary physiological dormancy. The induction of secondary physiological
   dormancy occurs at temperatures above 15 degrees C.

AB Chilling is a substantial stressor for plants. In fact, some biochemical
   reactions involved in growth and development of plant are sensitive to
   temperature. In particular, chilling stress represents a severe issue
   for plant growth and productivity and strategies to alleviate the stress
   is an important goal for agriculturists. While, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
   acts as a signalling molecule and its role in preventing several abiotic
   stresses like heat, salinity, drought etc. is well understood. Thus, the
   present study tested the effects of H2O2priming in mitigation of
   chilling stress at germination and seedling stage of rice. The rice
   seeds were treated with H2O2(5, 10 and 15 mM H2O2) solution for 24 h and
   exposed to chilling stress either for 6 h d-1 or 12 h d-1 for 7 days.
   Results revealed that chilling stress seriously impeded germination
   indices (germination percentage, germination rate index, coefficient of
   velocity of germination and mean germination time), morphological
   parameters (shoot length, root length and fresh weight), total
   chlorophyll content and antioxidant enzymes (catalase and ascorbate
   peroxidase) activity. On the other hand, priming with H2O2(5 mM, 10 mM
   and 15 mM) displayed protective effects on germination indices and
   growth parameters and conferred a significant tolerance against chilling
   stress. Priming with H2O2also significantly protected chlorophyll from
   chilling-induced degradation. Our results provide a strong foundation
   that priming with H2O2confers a positive physiological effect by
   enhancing antioxidant enzymes capability (increased catalase and
   ascorbate peroxidase activity) of chilling stressed rice plant. Among
   the concentrations, 10 mM H2O2performed relatively better in chilling
   stress alleviation. Therefore, this technique can be used for improved
   rice seedling production in northern part of Bangladesh under low
   temperature condition.

   Seedlings were planted out in a nursery bed and measured for 2 growing
   seasons: the mathematical relations between stratification and both
   seedling size and germination rate were studied. In (a), stratification
   for up to 30 days increased germination % whereas longer periods reduced
   it; in (b) stratification increased germination % throughout the range
   studied. The log-log relation between time to 50% of total germination
   and stratification period was linear for both (a) and (b). Total ht. of
   1st-yr seedlings was linearly related to the log of stratification
   period, but only for (b): the effect was small, and disappeared by the
   end of the 2nd season. The increase in seedling size appears to be an
   effect of stratification on hypocotyl extension. From author's summary.

AB European beech seeds are characterised by deep physiological dormancy
   and to germinate, they require several weeks of stratification at 3
   degrees C. Seed dormancy is under hormonal regulation, but the details
   of how hormones regulate deep dormancy in trees remain not yet well
   elucidated. We hypothesised that the mechanism of seed dormancy breaking
   is differentially regulated according to depth of dormancy. Expression
   of ABI5 and 14-3-3, members of the abscisic acid pathway, and RGL2, a
   member of gibberellic acid pathways, were examined at the protein and
   mRNA levels during dormancy alleviation of beech seeds. Unlike in
   non-deep dormant seeds, ABI5, 14-3-3 and RGL2 were present during nearly
   all periods of cold stratification in beech seeds, but during dormancy
   breaking and germination these proteins nearly disappeared. Relative
   abundances of ABI5 and 14-3-3 transcripts were the highest in dormant
   dry seeds, and during stratification it decreased gradually. We suppose
   that during stratification, de novo translation of proteins on the basis
   of deposited mRNA occurred. On the base of our research we can conclude
   that the seed dormancy breaking mechanism differs according to seed's
   dormancy depth.

AB The seagrass, Halophila ovalis plays an important ecological and
   sediment stability role in estuarine systems in Australia with the
   species in decline in many sites. Halophila ovalis is a facultative
   annual, relying mainly on recruitment from the sediment seed bank for
   the annual regeneration of meadows. Despite this, there is little
   understanding of seed dormancy releasing mechanisms and germination
   cues. Using H. ovalis seed from the warm temperate Swan River Estuary in
   Western Australia, the germination ecology of H. ovalis was investigated
   by simulating the natural seasonal variation in water temperatures. The
   proportion of germinating seeds was found to be significantly different
   among temperature treatments (p < 0.001). The treatment with the longest
   period of cold exposure at 15 degrees C followed by an increase in
   temperature to 20-25 degrees C (i.e. cold stratification) had the
   highest final mean germination of 32% and the fastest, germination rate.
   Seeds exposed to constant mean winter temperatures of 15 degrees C had
   the slowest germination rate with less than two seeds germinating over
   118 days. Thus temperature is a key germination cue for H. ovalis seeds
   and these data infer that cold stratification is an important dormancy
   releasing mechanism. This finding has implications for recruitment in
   facultative annual species like H. ovalis under global warming since the
   trend for increasing water temperatures in the region may limit seed
   -based recruitment in the future. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

AB Seedlots of sycamore maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.) originating from
   three different provenance regions were collected in autumn 2012. The
   seed quality, namely vitality and germination rate, was assessed
   according to Czech conventions. There were four replications within each
   seedlot, i.e. twelve treatments altogether for each experimental
   variant. The effect of gibberellic acid on germination and vitality was
   studied using three treatments including a control for germination
   capacity and three treatments including a control for emergence rate.
   The data shows that the gibberellic acid did not substitute for the
   stratification procedure as it did not improve the germination capacity
   of seeds with pericarp when compared with stratified seeds; however for
   seeds without pericarp the gibberellic acid improved the germination
   capacity to the level of stratified seeds. The data also shows the
   positive influence of gibberellic acid on emergence rate. All variants
   where acid gibberellic was applied have a statistically higher emergence
   rate than the control. The increase was about 50% higher than in the
   control, i.e. without the influence of gibberellic acid.

   reported together with an increase of germination % after previous
   treatment of Cannabis sativa seed with orthophosphorous acid. The
   shortening of the germination time was possibly due to enzymes. Catalase
   activity was determined by using a mercury manometer. Treated seed, even
   after stratification for only 1 hr. in the germination bed, showed
   higher catalase activity than resting seed. The activity then fell for
   about 6 hrs. (more, however, in the untreated than the treated seed),
   followed by a rapid increase of catalase activity at the time the

AB Rice cultivars (Oryza sativa L.) that are adapted to high altitude areas
   of the sub-tropics, such as Nepal, have to germinate and rapidly
   synthesize chlorophyll in the emerging plumule at chilling temperatures.
   This study was conducted to determine, at the chilling temperature of 17
   degrees C, the heritabilities of four traits: germination, the Fate of
   germination (RG) index, plumule greening, and plumule vigor. Estimates
   vi cre made in the F-3 generation of two crosses between two Nepalese
   chilling-tolerant cultivars and a chilling-susceptible Nepalese
   cultivar. Most traits were significantly heritable, Heritability
   estimates ranged from 0.7 to 0.9 for germination and the rate of
   germination, and was 0.7 for plumule vigor and for plumule greening at
   chilling temperature. Four methods of estimating germination rate were
   examined, Of these, an index that took into account final percentage
   germination, unlike the index usually used for rate of germination at
   optimal temperatures, gave the highest heritability, Predicted genetic
   advances due to selection were highest for germination rate and greening
   ability, All of the traits were significantly; correlated (P less than
   or equal to 0.05) with early seedling vigor in the field, We conclude
   that it would be useful in a breeding program for improved chilling
   tolerance to screen for germination rate with an index and to select for
   plumule greening ability because these traits are highly heritable,
   easily measured, and correlate well with field performance at high
   altitudes.

AB Ruppia maritima L. is a cosmopolitan species that dominates in highly
   variable environments with respect to hydrology, salinity and water
   quality. This species is critical in the development of aquatic habitats
   which support secondary production in the Everglades-Florida Bay ecotone
   coastal estuaries. While R. maritima has been identified as an indicator
   species for successful Everglades restoration, the factors controlling
   its current distribution are poorly understood making it difficult to
   predict its future presence, abundance and ability to support secondary
   production. In our ongoing research, we are experimentally examining the
   factors controlling R. maritima early life history including seed
   germination and seedling survival with a focus on salinity dynamics. In
   the experiments presented herein, we hypothesized that the highly
   variable salinity at the Everglades-Florida Bay ecotone promotes R.
   maritima seed germination, but that seedlings are sensitive to high
   salinities. We conducted a series of experiments examining seed
   germination across a range of salinities known to occur at the ecotone
   (0-45 psu) with and without low-temperature stratification (6-10 degrees
   C). Across this range of salinity, germination rates were low and
   primarily restricted to salinities <25 psu. However, when seeds were
   transferred to fresh water, significantly higher germination rates were
   observed in seeds previously exposed to high salinity. In fact, there
   was a strong positive linear relationship between prior salinity
   exposure level and germination rate once salinities were lowered (R-2 >=
   0.97). These results lead us to suggest that osmotic shifts from hyper-
   to hyposalinity promote R. maritima seed germination. This result
   explains a mechanism driving seed germination when annual temperatures
   remain higher than those previously recognized to cause seed
   stratification (<= 6 degrees C). Further, we found seeds germinated in
   relatively high temperatures (>30 degrees C) characteristic of the
   subtropics and were inhibited in low temperatures (10 degrees C), even
   with osmotic stratification. During seedling development, we observed
   that a slow rate of salinity increase allowed osmotic adjustment of
   seedlings and a high salinity tolerance up to 50 psu. As would be
   expected in seed-germinated aquatic species, nutrients and moderate
   salinity conditions were required to promote development of tissues
   beyond embryonic stages. In summary, we determined that R. maritima seed
   germination is promoted by variable salinity, but fresh water is
   necessary for germination and low salinities (<= 10 psu) enhance
   seedling development. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB The research objective was to study seed biology of 38 species from 33
   genera and 20 families belonging to rare and endangered plants of the
   southern part of Russian Far East. Among the species, 20 are distributed
   at the extreme borders of their ranges, 3 species are relicts, 7 species
   are endemics. Our research included assessment of seed size and weight
   variability, laboratory germination rate and viability of seeds, organic
   dormancy and ways to break it. Fruits and seeds used in the experiments
   were collected in 2011-2016 in the Amur Region, Khabarovsk, Trans-Baikal
   and Krasnoyarsk Territories, and the living collections of the Amur
   branch of Botanical Garden-Institute FEB RAS (Blagoveshchensk, Amur
   Region). The biological features of the seeds were studied by standard
   methods. To break the organic dormancy of the seeds, cold
   stratification, scarification, and treatment with GA(3) were used [14].
   For the most species laboratory germination rate of the seeds was
   determined using 4 samples (50 seeds each) according to the method
   developed for wild plant species [21]. The viability was calculated as
   the sum of germinated seeds and ungerminated ones, that retained their
   morphological features [22]. It was found that seed reproduction of the
   rare species collected from natural and cultural sites varied
   significantly in weight and size. The depth of organic dormancy of seeds
   varied within populations of Astilbe chinensis (Maxim.) Franch. et
   Savat., between populations of Platycodon grandiflorus (Jacq.) A. DC.
   4-months laboratory storage of recalcitrant seeds (Adonis amurensis
   Regel et Radde, Gagea hiensis Pascher) led to the loss of viability. For
   the tested species, the types of organic dormancy were revealed
   according to the classification of M. G. Nikolaeva et al. [14]. It was
   found that seeds of 11 species do not have organic dormancy, 19 species
   have physiological dormancy of varying depth, 6 species have
   morphophysiological dormancy, 1 species has combined exogenous and
   strong physiological dormancy, 1 species has combined exogenous and
   strong morphophysiological dormancy. The recommended temperature of
   germination is 22-24 degrees C for the seeds of the majority of tested
   species and 6-8 degrees C for the seeds of Delphinium korshinskyanum
   Nevski. Seeds of 7 species are photosensitive: Acelidanthus anticleoides

AB We introduced Epimedium wushanense seed which has been stratified for 90
   days at 10/20 ℃ as experimental materials, with which we studied the
   effects of fluridone, gibberellin acid and temperature on E. wushanense
   germination. The results were suggested as shown below. ①Temperature,
   fluridone and gibberellin acid can both solely or jointly affect
   germination energy, germination rate significantly. Among those factors,
   fluridone affect germination rate and germination energy the most,
   followed by gibberellin acid and temperature. The highest germination
   rate under 4 ℃ and 10/20 ℃ stratification are 79.3%, 72.0% respectively,
   which resulted from treatment of F10GA300 and F20GA200 respectively. The
   highest germination energy under 4 ℃ and 10/20 ℃ stratification are
   52.7%, 52.0%, respectively, which both resulted from F20GA200. ②Compared
   with 4 ℃ germination, seed could not germinate at 10/20 ℃ germination.
   Nontheless, application of fluridone can lead E. wushanense seeds to
   germinating.③The effects of gibberellin acid and interaction between
   gibberellin acid and fluridone significantly affect seed rotten rate
   during germination. In addition, soaking is another remarkable factor
   which increased seed rotten rate. As a result, it is feasible to promote
   E. wushanense dormancy releasing with gibberellin acid and fluridone
   associating with a proper germination temperature. Further, it is
   necessary taking actions to avoid seed rotten rate for saving E.
   wushanense nurseries'cost.

AB Several fundamental experiments were conducted for the propagation of
   wild Pimpinella brachycarpa. The improvement of seed germination
   frequency through dormancy breaking was investigated. Percentage of seed
   germination was higher under light condition than the dark. Seeds stored
   at low temperature after being mixed with wet sand(seed:sand = 50:50 in
   volume) germinated better than those stored in dry condition. It did not
   apply for seeds dried immediately after harvesting. Seeds stored at
   5degreeC showed higher percentage of germination than those stored at
   other temperatures(10 and 15degreeC). The germination percentage
   increased as storage period was extended enough to break seed dormancy.
   Germination rate of seeds, stored under best conditions and then treated
   with different concentrations of GA3 and kinetin, were significantly
   increased. Seeds stored for 100 days and treated with 500 mg/l of GA3
   and 10 mg/l of kinetin showed 70% and 40% germination rates,
   respectively. Seeds were germinated better at the alternate temperatures
   of 10/15degreeC and 10/20degreeC (alternated 12 hours each) than at a
   constant temperature under the light condition. Seeds stored for 140
   days in the field stratification right after harvesting, put under the
   alternate temperatures of 10/15 apprx 20degreeC in the light, and soaked
   in 500 mg/l of GA3 for 6 to 24 hours were germinated at 80% level.
   Content of ABA decreased as the storage duration extended: the ABA
   content of 43 muM in seed before storage decreased to 27 muM after 80
   days of storage.

   temperatures in the dark, and also at 20 degree C in the light. Seeds
   germinated only at 20 degree C. The germination rate of seeds in the

   seed was broken by cold stratification for over 30 days, and the
   germination rate increased as the cold stratification period increased
   from 30 to 131 days. The dormancy of seed was also broken by the
   treatment with a 500 ppm GA-3 solution. Freshly matured seeds were
   dormant, but they came out of dormancy in autumn. When sowed in April to
   August, the seeds germinated in autumn of the year regardless of the
   sowing time. The same seasonal changes were generally observed in the
   germination in the temperature-controlled germination test.

AB This paper aims to elucidate the effects of exogenous brassinolide (BL)
   on maize germination and seedling growth under chilling stress. The
   cold-resistant maize hybrid Tiannong 9 and the cold-sensitive hybrid
   Tianhe 1 were soaked at the germination stage (6 degrees C) and leaves
   were sprayed at seedling stage (4 degrees C), with BL at concentrations
   of 0, 0.01, 0.1, and 1 mg/L. The germination rate of the maize seeds and
   the changes in seedling biomass, antioxidant, photosynthetic, and plant
   endogenous hormone systems and chloroplast ultrastructures were
   determined. The results showed that the optimum concentration of BL to
   alleviate chilling stress in maize seedlings was 0.1 mg/L. This rate
   effectively increased the germination rate and plant biomass of maize
   and significantly increased the superoxide dismutase (SOD) peroxidase
   (POD) and catalase (CAT) activities, the net photosynthetic rate (Pn),
   stomatal conductance (gs) and transpiration rate (Tr), and seedling
   auxin (IAA), gibberellin (GA(3)) and trans zeatin nucleoside (t-ZR)
   contents under chilling stress. In addition, BL significantly reduced
   the malondialdehyde (MDA) content, abscisic acid (ABA) content, and
   intercellular carbon dioxide concentration (Ci). In the comparison of
   mesophyll cells, the chloroplast membrane of the treatment group was
   tightly attached to the stroma, and some of the plasma membranes were
   dissolved, but the overall structure of the chloroplast was relatively
   complete, and the osmiophilic granules were relatively few. The
   exogenous application of BL can effectively alleviate the damage caused
   by a low temperature in maize, maintain the normal characteristics of
   seedlings in chilling environments, and ensure the development and
   growth of plant tissue in the later stage.

   with the 100 ppm, 200 ppm and 300 ppm GA, seed treatment, Treated seeds
   were sown in the polythene bags (25*15 cm size, 200 gauge thick)
   containing soil, sand and FYM mixture (1:1:1). It was interesting to
   note that the effect of stratification duration and hormone treatment
   concentration was found to be significant for seed germination,
   transplanting success, seedling mortality percentage and rate of seed
   germination. Treatment T6 (48 hrs+300 ppm GA3) yielded highest
   percentage, (84.00) of seed germination while the lowest percentage
   value (37.25) was recorded in T0 (72 hrs+300 ppm GA3) treatment and the
   transplanting success was also lowest in T9. The seedling mortality
   percentage was maximum (79.25) with T9 where as lowest percentage value
   (22.00) was observed for T6 treatment. It may be concluded that T6
   treatment can be recommended for the better stand establishment of Aonla

AB Hungary is northernmost temperate rice growing country in Europe. One of
   the main limiting factors is low tempera -ture, especially at
   germination and seedling developmental stages. In early developmental
   stages, low temperature can impair and delay germination, as well as
   have negative im-pacts on seedling growth, causing poor stand
   establishment and non-uniform crop maturation [1] . Temperatures lower
   than 15 degrees C are generally detrimental for germination [2] un-der
   filed conditions for establishment of the crop. This arti-cle describes
   some key germination parameters of 165 rice accessions including
   breeding lines and varieties. Each geno-type was grown in three
   replicates in a controlled cabinet under 13 degrees C for 4 weeks'
   duration. Growth was measured every 7th day. Growth traits such as
   coleoptile and radicle length were measured at the end of the
   experiment. The av-erage data were calculated for three replicates. This
   dataset contains germination raw data and five germination param-eters
   such as median germination time (MGT), final germi-nation percentage
   (FGP), germination index (GI), coleoptile length (CL) and radicle length
   (RL). These data may provide reliable support for researchers and
   breeders to select the right rice genotypes for low temperature

   study was carried out in 2016 to determine the most effective treatment
   for stimulating germination of mountain celery seeds. A factorial
   experiment based on a completely randomized design with four
   replications was used. Effects of stratification (4 degrees C for 0, 4

   increased percentage germination and germination parameters, namely
   germination rate, mean germination time and radicle length. On average,
   the highest percentage germination, germination rate and radicle length
   were obtained upon treatments with GA(3), BA and GA(3)+ IBA+BA, after
   eight weeks of stratification at 4 degrees C, suggesting that seeds of
   this species exhibit physiological dormancy. GA(3), BA and GA(3)+IBA+BA
   after eight weeks of stratification at 4 degrees C were the most
   effective treatments. There were no synergistic effects among hormonal
   treatments.

AB Leucaena leucocephala and Acacia farnesiana are tree species used for
   several agricultural purposes in the Mediterranean region. The seeds of
   these species exhibit dormancy, causing delayed germination. Two
   experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of pre-sowing
   treatments (scarification, hot water, or soaking) on seed germination of
   L. leucocephala and A. farnesiana. In one experiment, seeds were exposed
   to three pre-sowing treatments: control, sandpaper scarification, or
   soaking in 70A degrees C water for 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, or 24 min. In
   another experiment, seeds were soaked in 70A degrees C water for 20 min,
   and then soaked in water at room temperature for an additional 24, 48,
   or 72 h or blade scarified. In general, soaking the seeds of the two
   species in hot water was more effective in breaking seed dormancy than
   scarification. Sandpaper scarification was not effective for either
   species. Blade scarification increased A. farnesiana seed germination to
   56%, indicating that seed dormancy was mainly a consequence of
   hardseededness. L. leucocephala seeds collected from Jordan University
   of Science and Technology (JUST) site and soaked in 70A degrees C water
   for 20 min and then soaked for 24, 48, or 72 h had germination rates
   above 97%. Our results suggest that blade scarification of A. farnesiana
   seeds and soaking of L. leucocephala seeds in 70A degrees C water for 20
   min are effective treatments to break seed dormancy and enhance seed
   germination of these vital species.

   Results showed that interaction effects of treatments were significant
   on all morphological traits of germination in soybean except plumule dry
   weight. The greatest plumule length (20-22 cm) belonged to the Clean
   cultivar with 30 days pre-chilling. Germination percentage and rate
   increased by increasing pre-chilling period and the greatest germination
   percentage (100%) was related to 40 days pre-chilling in Liford
   cultivar. The maximum dry weight of radicle (0.205 g) was obtained with
   Linford cultivar and 40 days pre-chilling. Increasing the pre-chilling
   period increased the seed reservoir using rate and the greatest amount
   of seed reservoir using rate (2.082 g) was observed with 40 days
   pre-chilling in Clean cultivar. Germination percentage showed positive
   correlation at%1 possibility with germination rate, plumule length,

AB Due to sensitivity of soybean seedlings to cold, in order to study the
   effect of chilling duration and cultivar on physiological
   characteristics of soybean seed germination, a factorial trial in random
   block design with five level of pre-chilling (control, 10, 20, 30, 40
   days in 4°C) and three cultivars (JK, Linford and Clean) with three
   replication was conducted in the seed science and technology laboratory
   of Mohaghegh Ardebili University in 2014. Traits like the percentage of
   germination, germination rate, Sodium (Na) content, Calcium (Ca)
   content, Potassium (K) content, Electrical conductivity (EC), soluble
   sugar content, Catalase and Peroxidase enzyme activity were measured.
   The interaction of cultivar and pre-chilling was significant on all
   biochemical traits of seed germination except Peroxidase and Catalase
   enzyme activity and EC. Highest germination percentage and rate happened
   in 40 days pre-chilling treatment. The EC of seeds was increased by 27
   percent with increase in the duration of chilling from control (no
   chilling) to 40 days chilling. Cultivar and chilling interaction on
   inorganic elements Na, K and Ca were significant, the percentage of Na
   decreased and percentage of K and Ca increased with increase in duration
   of chilling. 40 days of chilling caused 8.5 percent increase in soluble
   sugar compare to control (no chilling). The activity of antioxidant
   enzymes Catalase and Peroxidase, rose with the increase in duration of
   chilling. The highest activity of Catalase enzyme was gained from the
   cold resistant cultivar (JK) with 8.507 M/min*g (fresh weight) and the
   highest Peroxidase enzyme activity yielded from 40 days chilling
   treatment with amount of 37.243 M/min* g (fresh weight). According to
   the physiological result the 40 days chilling treatment, due to high
   germination percentage and rate, high antioxidant enzyme activity and
   soluble sugar, is recommended for sowing and better seedling
   establishment.

AB Medicinal barberry plants, belong to Berberidaceae family. Seeds of
   barberry have long period dormancy. Therefore, overcome to seed dormancy
   and increasing germination rate of seeds due to different methods will
   be useful. In this regard, two separate experiments were designed. In
   the first experiment, effect of different levels of Gibberellic acid (0,
   600 and 900 mg.l-1 at 8°C) and temperatures (25 (control), 10 and 5°C at
   50 days) in a factorial experiment based on the completely randomized
   design with three replications and in the second experiment, effect of
   different nutrition concentrations of MS medium (full strength MS, 1/2
   MS and 1/4 MS) in a completely randomized design with three replications
   on embryo culture of four native species of barberry (Berberis
   integrima, B. vulgaris, B. crataegina and B. orthootrys) were
   investigated. Based on the results obtained from the first experiment,
   chilling treated seeds showed the greatest effect (88%) on seed
   germination in comparison with gibberellic acid treatment. The results
   of the second experiment showed that the best MS concentration for
   embryo culture was full strength MS medium with % 100 seed germination
   in four above mentioned barberry species after 2-3 days. In general, the
   best method to overcome barberry seed dormancy was an embryo culture in
   full-strength MS nutrition.

AB Reduced seed germination is among the most important factors adversely
   affecting crop stand and subsequent plant growth. Fennel (Foeniculum
   vulgare Mill) is an important medicinal plant with poor seed germination
   rate, occasionally. It is accordingly pertinent to find methods which
   can enhance fennel seed germination and remove the barriers of dormancy
   breaking. The present experiments studied the effects of two different
   priming (cold moist stratification and osmopriming) and 14 dormancy
   breaking techniques (hormonal, osmopriming, biopriming, chemical
   priming, and hydropriming) on the seed germination and seedling growth
   of two different fennel genotypes under growth chamber conditions. In
   the first and second experiment, the priming techniques including the
   time lengths of cold moist stratification (0, 15, 30, and 45 days) and
   the concentrations of polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG(6000), osmopriming
   at -0.99, -1.35, and -2.33 MPa) were used as the main plots. However, in
   both experiments, the dormancy breaking techniques and fennel genotypes
   were factorially combined and used as the subplots. Different seed- and
   seedling-related parameters including germination (%), plumule, radicle
   and seedling length, average germination time, rate and homogeneity of
   germination, and seed vigor index were determined. Both priming
   techniques were efficient on the enhancement of seed germination and
   seedling growth. Among the dormancy breaking techniques, Aminol Forte
   (biopriming), kadostim (biopriming), benzyl adenine + kinetin
   (biopriming), distilled water (hydropriming), gibberellin + kinetin
   (hormonal priming), and benzyl adenine + kinetin + gibberellin
   (biopriming) were the most effective ones. The related concentrations
   were equal to 100 mg/l, 10(-5) M, and 0.4 %. The fennel genotypes
   reacted significantly different under priming conditions. It is possible
   to enhance seed germination and seedling growth of fennel using priming
   and dormancy breaking techniques, which is useful for the increased
   production of fennel under different conditions. The results indicate
   that bio and hydropriming techniques were among the most effective ones,
   which significantly increased seed germination and seedling growth, and
   removed the seed dormancy barriers.

   results showed that in (1), soaking the seeds for more than 10 days at 0
   °C and sowing the seeds without covering them with soil increased the
   germination rate dramatically. The most effective seedling compost had
   pH of 5.0-5.4, solid-phase rate of 10% and water content of 30 ml/100
   ml. In (2), applying nitrogen fertilizer 10 kg/10 a and 5 kg/10 a in
   April and June, respectively, was most effective. Some late flowering
   cultivars needed extra fertilizer in June. In (3), the half-forcing
   culture by using double layered greenhouse managed to produce flowers a
   month earlier than open-field culture and was found economical and

AB Experiments were carried out to investigate the germination traits of
   Fraxinus lanuginosa fruits. The optimal temperature for germination was
   20°C; although fruits at lower temperatures (10°C and 15°C) retained
   their viability, their germination was inhibited. While seeds extracted
   from fruits showed significantly higher germination percentages than
   intact fruits, partial scarification of the pericarp to enhance water
   permeability to the inner seed did not facilitate germination. This
   indicates that the dormancy of the fruit is mainly due to the physical
   inhibition of embryo growth by the pericarp. A pre-moist chilling
   treatment had a significant effect on breaking dormancy and enhancing
   the germination rate. However, since a substantial number of intact
   fruits was able to germinate without pre-treatment, we concluded that
   the dormancy of F. lanuginosa fruit is not very deep. These traits would
   be sufficient to prevent precocious germination of F. lanuginosa during
   the fruit-dispersal season in southeastern Hokkaido, Japan, which is
   characterized by a cool autumn followed by a severe winter.

AB Direct planting of mature and immature seeds of the gray mangrove,
   Avicennia marina (Forsk.) Vierh, is an effective method for mangrove
   afforestation along the desert coastline of the United Arab Emirates.
   For afforestation under the severe weather and environmental conditions
   on this desert coast, a large number of seeds should be stored in good
   condition until the time of planting. However the optimum method for
   practical storage of mangrove seeds has not been examined. Generally,
   mangrove seeds cannot be stored for a long period due to their
   viviparous character. Gray mangrove seeds have a pericarp for floatation
   in seawater, and the pericarp also affords protection from dry
   conditions when the seeds reach the high tide line in the intertidal
   zone. This characteristic of the pericarp was utilized for seed stotage.
   Storage in direct sunlight or in a refrigerator is harmful to seeds
   because of irradiation and chilling. Therefore, an air-conditioned room
   with a constant temperature of 24-25degreeC and moisture 48-55%
   humidity, or a corridor with an air temperature 31-34degreeC and 70-80%
   humidity are suitable places for storing a large number of seeds in good
   condition. Fresh seeds with pericarp lose weight gradually during
   storinge, and able to remain viable until they lose 32% of their weight.
   Such seeds can be stored for 23 days in an air-conditioned room, or 18
   days in a corridor. Fresh seeds without a pericarp can be stored 5 days
   in both places, but 20 days is the absolute storage limit after pericarp
   removal. The pericarp of all seeds should be removed before planting to
   inprove the germination rate and avoid flotation in seawater. After
   soaking for various periods in running or still seawater, the pericarp
   can be removed easily by handsfrom allseeds without damage to the
   cotyledons. Fresh seeds require 1-2 days in still seawater (32degreeC
   and 40.5permill), and 6 hours soaking is enough for removing the
   pericarp from seeds stored for 20 days.

AB Studies were conducted to explore the effects of monocyandiamide
   treatment on the growth and development of different grape cultivars
   (Zaoheibao, Zaoxia Meigui and Shaoxing No. 1) and determine the
   physiological and biochemical mechanisms of dormancy breaking of grapes.
   The 3 grape cultivars were treated with sleeping breaking agent hydrogen
   cyanamide (H2CN2) with water as the control (CK). The budding stage,
   flowering stage, berry coloring stage and ripening stage of each grape
   cultivar were recorded, and the uniformity of germination, germination
   rate, berry setting rate, fruiting cane rate, diameter change of
   fruiting mother cane, bearing position, internode length, leaf length,
   leaf width and the growth dynamics of new buds, leaves and fruits were
   calculated. The development of each grape bud after dormancy breaking
   treatment was observed by paraffin section. The content of H2O2, and the
   activity of POD and CAT were measured. The photosynthetic pigment of
   mature leaves was measured by ethanol extraction method. The length and
   width of grape bunch were measured by tape measure. The weights of grape
   bunch and berry grain were measured by an analytical balance. The
   vertical and horizontal diameters of berry grain and the thickness of
   berry peel were measured by a Vernier caliper. The ratio of vertical to
   horizontal diameter of berry grains was fruit shape index. The hardness
   of berry was determined by a hardness index measure with a thermometer.
   The method for measuring soluble solids, total sugar and acid-base
   titration and vitamin C content was determined by 2,6-dichloroindophenol
   titration method; the relative content of total phenols and flavonoids
   was determined by hydrochloric acid methanol method; the relative
   content of total anthocyanins in pericarp was determined by hydrochloric
   acid absolute ethanol extraction method. Combined with principal
   component analysis (PCA) and comprehensive evaluation index, the main
   influencing factors of monocyandiamide on grape dormancy were screened,
   and the effects of monocyandiamide on the growth and development of
   different grape cultivars and their comprehensive berry quality were
   explored. Results showed that the germination uniformity, germination
   rate, H2O2 content and POD and CAT activities were the main influencing
   factors for breaking dormancy in grape. The comprehensive quality of
   Zaoheibao grape berries was better than that of Zaoxia Meigui and
   Shaoxing No. 1 after treatment with H2CN2.

AB Freshly harvested seeds of Chimonanthus praecox had high viability (97%)
   but were dormant. Scarification accelerated seed water uptake, but it
   did not fully eliminate dormancy. Dry storage at room temperature for
   six months, warm plus cold dry storage (20 degrees C for 12 weeks plus 5
   degrees C for 8 weeks) and cold (5 degrees C) stratification broke
   dormancy and allowed germination of over 90% at 23 degrees C. Although
   fresh seeds positively responded to GA(3) solutions, the highest
   germination achieved was only 53% at 400 mg/L GA(3) Germination was
   always greater at 23 degrees C than at 20/10 degrees C or 15 degrees C.
   The results indicated that in natural conditions, this non-deep
   physiological dormancy and the restraint of the seed coat are important
   factors that delay the germination of C. praecox seeds. In practice,
   cold stratification (5 degrees C for 12 weeks) was the quickest of the
   methods used to break dormancy in this species.

   progresses slowly. Different treatments were evaluated to develop a
   protocol for accelerating the germination of this species. For
   dormancy-broken seeds, the condition of 10/20 degrees C with a 12 h
   light period was appropriate. Cold stratification for 60 days resulted
   in significantly increasing final germination percentages from 13 (fresh
   seeds) to 97%, the median germination time (MGT) was approximately 17 d
   and is therefore recommended as the practical germination pre-treatment
   for propagating D. tristaniaecarpa by seeds. Moreover, among four
   concentrations applied, 200 mg.L-1 of GA(3) was more effective for
   accelerating germination of 40-d dry stratified seeds and its MGT was
   about 12 d. Based on the results, 60-d cold stratification (4 degrees C)
   was the optimal means for alleviating the primary dormancy.

AB Seed dormancy is an adaptive response of plants to environmental changes
   during long-term evolution. It plays an important role in plant survival
   and propagation. Acer cinnamomifolium, a plant species endemic to China,
   is an excellent garden and street tree species. However, dormancy and
   germination characteristics of A. cinnamomifolium seeds are not
   currently known. In the present paper, the mature seeds were used as
   experimental materials and we investigated the effect of temperature
   including alternating temperature, light, after-ripening, stratification
   and phytohormone on seed dormancy release and germination. After being
   incubated for 30 days, 0 to 10% of the seeds germinated in constant
   temperature (10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 degrees C), while in alternating
   temperature regimes (20/10, 25/15 and 30/20 degrees C), seed germination
   was < 35%. Dormancy release and germination of seeds can be increased by
   after-ripening, cold stratification and phytohormone treatments. We
   concluded that A. cinnamomifolium seeds have a non-deep physiological
   dormancy. Cold stratification at 4 degrees C for 30 days and incubation
   thereafter at 20 degrees C were found to be optimal for dormancy release
   and high seed germination.

AB Seed dormancy behavior of weed seeds is a critical determinant of their

   herbicides and other weeding practices. We investigated the effects of
   red light, alternating temperature, stratification duration and
   different doses of nitrogen containing compounds alone or in combination
   with red light on breaking seed dormancy of Chenopodium album L. The
   application of red light (80 mols-1 m-2) significantly increased seed
   germination of C. album in all treatments. Germination rates of 12 h
   incubated seeds were highest under 20 min of red light irradiation than
   1 min, 5 min and 10 min treated seeds. Germination rate was
   significantly higher at alternating temperatures of 25°C and 5°C for 12
   h each with an irradiation of red light (80 mols-1 m-2) for 10 min than
   other treatments. Stratification period of 15 days significantly
   stimulated germination percentage of seeds incubated in dark, although 5
   days of stratification along with red light application for 10 minutes
   exhibit similar effects on seeds. Seed germination was also enhanced by
   nitrogen containing compounds like NaNO2, KNO3, NH4Cl and NH4NO3. We
   observed that seed germination increased significantly with 25 mM KNO3
   and 10 mM NH4NO3 in dark condition, while NaNO2 and NH4Cl enhanced seed
   germination under red light irradiation. It was concluded that red light
   alone or synergized with alternating temperatures, stratification and
   nitrogen compounds, especially nitrite and ammonium enhanced seed
   germination of C. album. Thus, the red light can play a vital role in
   present and future weed management strategies.

   did not affect fifth instar mortality caused by N. rileyi, the median
   lethal time (LT50) values were shorter upon incubating under light than
   in darkness. Incubation of infected cadavers under 12 or 24 h light
   resulted in 20-fold more conidial production than under full darkness.
   Therefore. illumination is necessary for development of this isolate on

AB Germination ability of rice seeds at a low varies with the cultivars,
   However, the mechanism of this difference has not been clarified, To
   analyze the role of active oxygen-scavegning enzymes in germination at a
   low temperature, calatase activity in rice seed embryo was determined,
   The specific activity of catalase increased during germination and the
   rate of increase was high in cultivars with a high germination ability
   at a low temperature. Catalase activity was detected even in the embryo
   of dry seeds (before imbibition). This initial level of catalase also
   varied with the cultivars and there was a positive correlation between
   initial level of catalase activity and germination rate at a low
   temperature, Such a relation was not observed between the superoxide
   dismutase activity of dry seed embryo and germination rate at a low
   temperature, It was also found that cultivars with a high initial level
   of catalase activity in the embryo could germinate even in a 3% hydrogen
   peroxide solution, These characteristics reflect one of the genetic
   traits of rice.

   enhanced in vitro seed germination of Polygonatum verticillatum (L.)
   All., a valuable medicinal herb of Asparagaceae family. P. verticillatum
   shows pronounced seed dormancy and takes more than two years to attain
   crop maturity after sowing under natural conditions. Cold moist
   stratification of P. verticillatum seeds at 4 +/- 1 degrees C for 4
   weeks followed by gibberellic acid (100 mg/L) treatment for 15 days and
   then their germination in 100 mg/L gibberellic acid (GA(3)) and lmg/L
   kinetin (Kn)+ lmg/L indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) supplemented Murashige
   and Skoog (MS) medium under 16/8h light/dark condition resulted in early
   and uniform emergence of hypocotyls, epicotyls and coleoptiles leading
   to improved seed germination of this plant.
   Cold moist stratified seeds (with GA(3) pretreatment) germinated in 50
   to 100 mg/L GA(3) supplemented MS medium were found to show
   significantly enhanced mean germination rate and seed vigor index
   (p<0.05). GA(3) at a level of 100mg/L was found effective for both
   pretreatment of seeds as well as a supplement in MS medium. Using the
   above mentioned treatments, time requirement for germination and
   seedling establishment of this valuable medicinal herb was reduced to
   less than half the time required in natural conditions.

AB Rattail fescue has become increasingly problematic in North America as a
   result of the greater adoption of no-till practices. While rattail
   fescue is described generally as a winter annual, there exists a wide
   variation in the life history documentation of the species. In some
   instances, rattail fescue has been observed behaving as a spring annual.
   In order to assess the vernalization plasticity of rattail fescue,
   laboratory-germinated seedlings from two climatically different rattail
   fescue populations, eastern versus western Oregon, were exposed to 4, 7
   or 10 degrees C temperatures for 0, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6.5, 7 or 8 weeks of
   vernalization. Following vernalization, the seedlings were transferred
   to a greenhouse and the developmental stages were recorded. After 13
   weeks, the emergent inflorescences were clipped and the seeds were
   tested for germinability. The initiation of sexual development in the
   eastern population was affected significantly by the vernalization
   temperature and length, while the western population only responded to
   the vernalization length. In general, a faster progression through the
   reproductive stages of development was associated with longer
   vernalization lengths. Lastly, there was an increase in the germination
   rate of the seeds that were produced on the parent plants that were
   subjected to longer vernalization lengths, regardless of the population
   or vernalization temperature. The level of plasticity in the
   vernalization response between the two tested populations indicates that
   land managers should monitor local population life history traits in
   order to ensure that effective weed control is implemented at the
   correct growth stage.

AB Opuntia humifusa (Rafinesque) Rafinesque belongs to the anthropophyte
   flora of Bulgaria. The germination properties of O. humifusa Rafinesque
   were tested ex situ on fresh and stored seeds with two different soil
   substrates: (1) taken directly from the location (A) and (2) mixture of
   compost, sand and gravel in 1:1:1 ratio (B, C, D), The experiments were
   carried out in 2002 and 2007. Germination registered in 2007 of fresh
   and stored seeds exceeded several times that recorded in 2002. The
   stratification of seeds from crops 2002 and 2007, as well the extremely
   high temperatures during 2007 (above 30°) most probably favoured not
   only the high germination rate but also the rapid germination of the
   seeds (12 days versus 23 days in 2002 tests). The germination rate of
   refrigerated seeds exceeded between the rates recorded for the same
   fresh seeds 5 and 19 times. The results indicate that storage at low
   positive temperatures encourages the germinating process. Seedlings
   growth is slow, but steady and the seedlings are well balanced. The
   first pad of the seedlings occurs 30 days after germination and three
   months after sowing their average height is 2,7 cm (max 3,2; min 0,5
   cm).

AB Parkia timoriana (DC.) Merr. is one of the lesser known multipurpose
   leguminous tree species found in North East India. Like many other
   legumes this species too have hard coated seeds which prevent seed
   germination and thus there is a need to investigate the most appropriate
   method to break its dormancy. Six pre treatments (tap water, gibberellic
   acid (GA(3)) @ 500 ppm, stratification, sulphuric acid @ 98%, boiling
   water and nicking) and two media (top of paper (TOP) and sand) were use
   to evaluate seed germination traits and initial growth parameters of the
   seedling of this tree species. Along with these pre treatments, seeds
   sown in TOP media and tap water gave maximum seed germination (72%) and
   it was followed by seeds exposed to GA(3) for 24 hours (64%) while the
   least seed germination was reported in seeds treated with sulphuric acid
   (H2SO4) for 5 minutes. Least germination time (Mean Germination Time)
   was reported from the seeds treated with H2SO4 for 1 minute while
   maximum was reported from the boiling water treatments. Under sand
   medium, highest germination was reported in control (66.67 %) and it was
   followed by boiling water treatment (58.33%) and minimum (16.67%) in
   seeds treated with H2SO4 for 5 minute. Seed treated with H2SO4 for 5
   minutes took minimum germination time too. Interestingly, irrespective
   to the media, all the seedling growth parameters showed maximum response
   towards hormonal (GA(3)) treatment and minimum towards H2SO4 treatment.
   Significant correlations were found between all the seedling growth
   parameters except for collar diameter and root-shoot ratio.

AB Variation between families in seed production, germination, dormancy and
   weights were studied in beechnuts collected from 20 individual beech
   (Fagus sylvatica L.) trees from a Danish stand, two different years
   (1993 & 1995). Combined cold treatment and germination at 5 C was
   compared with cold treatment for 5, 7 and 9 weeks and germination at 15
   C. Finally, the effect of the pericarp on variation and level of
   dormancy was studied.
   Significant family differences in seed weight, germination percentages,
   mean germination time (dormancy) and seed production were found. No
   simple correlation between germination and dormancy was observed: the
   correlation between germination and germination time was zero in
   1993-seed lots, whereas there was observed a significant correlation
   between low germination and slow germination in 1995-seed lots. Seed
   weights correlated significant between the two years, indicating a
   genetic component in this trait, and the seed weight also correlated
   significantly with germination in 1995-seed lots, but not in the
   1993-seed lots. Germination percent and germination time did in general
   not correlate with seed yield.
   The effects of variation in germination percentages and dormancy on the
   effective population number (N-8) were moderate: decreases in N-s on
   8-10% for germination percentages and 10-12% for dormancy, whereas
   variation in tree to tree seed production alone resulted in a decrease
   in N-s on 27 %. Combined cold treatment and germination at 5 degreesC
   resulted in higher germination percentages than cold treatment for 5; 7
   and 9 weeks and subsequent transfer to 15 degreesC.
   Removal of the pericarp resulted in 3 to 25 days reduction in mean
   germination time (mgt) for the different single tree seed lots. The mean
   reduction in mgt was 9-10 days. Germination in "pericarp extract"
   indicated that inhibiting substances in the pericarp play a major role
   in delaying germination, whereas delay in imbibition of water was found
   to be of minor significance.

   under controlled laboratory conditions. Results showed that, after 30 d
   of seed germination, low salinity had a significant effect on the seed
   germination of Z. marina (P<0.05). The germination rate and gellnination
   index (GI) of seeds under the salinity of 25 were 36.3 times and 58.9
   times as high as those of seeds from the control group (0.67% and 0.07),
   while the mean time-to-germinate (MTG) was lowered down to 9.3 d. Seed
   germination rate and GI gradually increased as salinity decreased,
   whereas an opposite trend was observed in MTG. In addition, acupuncture
   significantly promoted seed germination, as the germination rate and GI
   of the seeds in this treatment were 26.9 and 42.7 times as high as those
   of the seeds in the control group, whereas MTG was lowered down to 12.6
   d. However, seed germination was not significantly affected by acid,
   hormone, drug, fluctuating temperature, and low-temperature
   stratification. By contrast, the establishment rate of seed-generated
   seedlings was significantly higher in the low-salinity treatments (with
   salinity of 10-25) than in the control treatment. However, no obvious
   difference in morphology was found between these treatments. The
   seed-generated seedlings in the acupuncture treatment all died at the
   end of the experiment (30 d). The results indicated that low salinity
   could promote Z. marina seed germination, and the optimum salinity range
   for rapid seed germination is from 10 to 25.

   1% level) and for Phellodendron amurense at the 5% level. In these
   species the highest germination rate (35-91%) was produced by treatment
   D. Pretreatment effects were significant at the 1% level for Chaenomeles
   [Cydonia] sinensis, pretreatment C being most effective (80%
   germination). There was no significant pretreatment effect for Cudrania
   tricuspidata.

   at 20 degrees C in 3% KNO3 solution. Germination of primed seeds at low
   temperature was evaluated before and after seed storage at room
   temperature. Results revealed that all priming treatments significantly
   improved final germination percentage (FGP) and germination rate of both
   Amaranthus species at 15 degrees C when compared to untreated seeds. The
   highest FGP was obtained from the seeds primed in the presence of 3 mu M
   ACC (86%) and 1 mu M MeJA (15%) for A. cruentus and A. caudatus,
   respectively. Four months storage of primed A. cruentus seeds revealed
   that the beneficial effects were not significantly reversed during
   storage. However, extending storage time to 8 months resulted in a
   slight reduction on FGPs in all priming treatments. The results of this
   study indicated that the inclusion of 3 mu M ACC into 3% KNO3 priming

   of A. cruentus seeds at 15 degrees C and that these seeds maintained the
   effects of priming in the presence of ACC when stored for 4 months at

AB Seed's dormancy is considered as one of the effective factors in seeds
   germination and consequently in the growth of seeds of many plant
   species. Shortening the dormancy period and enhancing the germination
   percentage in fruit types could be a valuable strategy for the seed
   researchers and plant nurseries. In this research the seeds of mature
   fruits of different almond cultivars including late-very late flowering
   (Sahand), mid-late flowering (Touno) and early-very early flowering
   (Najafabad) cultivars with hard shells after being collected and
   prepared, were separated from the hull and were preserved under 18% dry
   moisture till the beginning of the experiment in a proper place. Seeds
   were disinfected with 2%TMTD (Tetramethyl thiuram disulphide) fungicide
   solution for 30 minutes. Treated seeds, with and without endocarp, were
   stratified at 4°C for 1-15 weeks. The numbers of germinated seeds were
   recorded weekly for each cultivar. The seeds were examined during cold
   stratification 4°C due with a view to the germination once a week. The
   results showed that different treatments have significant effect on the
   decrease of the time of different cultivars' seed germination; in other
   words, on the decrease of the chilling requirement in them. In hard
   shell seeds of Touno, Sahand and Najafabad cultivars with different
   flowering time had higher germination rate and uniformity, respectively.

AB Reseda lutea is a perennial broadleaf weed that is native to the
   Mediterranean Basin and Asia Minor. In Hungary the weed can be observed
   mainly along roadsides and on non-cultivated areas. In Csongrad county
   Reseda lutea is one of the most difficult weeds to control in onion
   fields. Examinations were carried out to study the reproduction biology
   of Reseda lutea. The primary dormancy of the weed seeds was broken 8
   weeks after ripening. The optimum. temperature for germination was 24
   degrees C. Light seemed to inhibit the germination of seeds. Both
   stratification and gibberelic-acid (GA) treatment enhanced germination
   rate. Seeds of Yellow mignonette emerged from the upper 3 cm depth of
   soil with a maximum emergence rate of 6% from 0.5 cm depth. Field
   emergence of Reseda lutea started with the beginning of May with
   increasing temperature. In two years average 6.8% of the seeds
   germinated from May until the beginning of June. In 1996 there was no
   emergence in the following months, while in 1997 the germination was
   1.5% even at the end of July. It was also observed that the vegetative
   reproduction of Reseda lutea is important. The weeds can regenerate from
   primary as well as secondary root fragments. Roots of Reseda lutea are
   dormant during a period from June until September.

AB Native species are recommended for use in landscape restoration because
   they adapt well to the local pedo-climatic conditions. Despite the high
   biodiversity in the Mediterranean, the use of native plants is hampered
   by the limited knowledge of their seed germination. This is particularly
   true for a number of plants which are appropriate for creating
   species-rich herbaceous communities. In this study, seeds of 35 species
   were collected in different roadside and degraded sites in rural and
   urban areas. Two experiments were carried out to determine the influence
   of light and thermal conditions on seed germination. In the first
   experiment, seeds of 17 species were tested at different temperatures
   (5, 15, and 25 degrees C). At 15 degrees C, seed germination was tested
   under both dark and light conditions. In the second experiment, the
   germination of 30 species was tested under alternating temperatures
   (25/15 degrees C) and dark/light conditions. The responses of the
   various species differed in relation to thermal levels and light
   conditions, e.g., Bartsia trixago did not germinate in the dark at
   constant temperatures (5, 15, and 25 degrees C), while in the light (15
   degrees C) and at alternating temperatures (25/15 degrees C) in light
   and dark conditions, germination was over 60%. In both experiments,
   Tragopogon porrifolius and Triticum ovatum showed the highest
   germination rate (88%). With the sole exception of Medicago orbicularis,
   all members of the Fabaceae showed no or low germination. The definition
   of the germination requirements of some Mediterranean species,
   highlighted in these experiments, provides useful information for the
   creation of low input green areas and environmental restoration using
   these species.

   and immunomodulatory properties. Serum proteins electrophoresis and
   plasma lipid peroxidation were evaluated in broilers fed with diets
   supplemented with antibiotics or essential oils from oregano (Origanum
   vulgare L.), sage (Salvia officinalis L.), rosemary (Rosmarinus
   officinalis L.) and pepper (Capsicum frutescens L.) crude extract
   (OLES). The animals (n = 910) were distributed within five treatment
   groups and seven replicates containing 26 birds each one: control group
   (diet without additives); the group receiving an antibiotic growth
   promoter diet (Tatb); and the groups T50, T100 and T150 (supplemented
   with 50, 100 and 150mg kg(-1) of OLES, respectively). After 42 days,
   seven animals were randomly selected for serum proteins electrophoretic
   fractionation and plasma lipid peroxidation evaluation by thiobarbituric
   acid reactive species (TBARS) test. Total globulins (T150), betaglobulin
   fraction (Tatb and T150) and plasma TBARS levels in the groups that
   received OLES (P<0.05) presented a decrease in relation to the control
   group. These results suggests lower stimulus to the humoral immune
   response at the higher dose of OLES, as occurred in the antibiotic
   growth promoter group. Moreover, it suggests lower lipid peroxidation
   and, consequently, lower oxidative damage caused by OLES use in broiler
   chickens.

   consumed as a vegetable, was investigated. For this purpose, sterilized
   seeds were exposed to boiling water (95°C; 10 and 30 seconds, 1, 5 and
   10 minutes), hot water (80°C; 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes), sulfuric acid
   (98%; 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 minutes) and pre-cooling (4°C; 2, 3 and 4
   days) treatments. The experiments were carried out according to
   randomized blocks trial design with 4 replications and 50 seeds per
   replicate. According to results obtained, germination rate 0.00-97.00%,
   average germination time 0.00-3.98 days, germination index 0.00-46.89,
   emergence rate 0.00-82.00%, average emergence time 0.00-7.52 days,
   emergence index 0.00-18.70, hypocotyl length 0.00-1.79 cm and radicle
   length values varied between 0.00 and 4.28 cm. The most successful
   treatments in terms of germination and emergence parameters were
   pre-chilling, sulfuric acid (for 5 and 10 minutes) and boiled water (at
   95°C for 10 seconds) applications. As a result of the study, in order to
   remove the dormancy from the Corchorus olitorius L. seeds, treatment of
   the seeds with pre-cooling (4°C for 2 days) in a humid environment
   before sowing would be easily practiced.

   24+24 h) and a cold phase of 3°C up to the onset of germination (15-18

   3/15°C or 3/20°C (16+8 h) from the onset of germination. Drying stones
   after collection increased germination rate from 18-39.5% to 49.5-65.5%.
   Comparisons of conditions during the 2 months (July and August) prior to

AB The observed juniper decline, lack of natural regeneration, and
   disappearance of numerous populations of the common juniper in Poland,
   were the major reasons for initiation of research on its sexual
   propagation and seedling production. This study shows that seed dormancy
   in this species is broken by warm-cold stratification at 15 degrees C/3
   degrees C, for 14+12 weeks, respectively. Seed drying for 72 h at room
   temperature in the middle of the warm phase (i.e. after 4-8 weeks of
   stratification at 15 degrees C) and the following cold stratification at
   3 degrees C, cause a significant increase in seed germination capacity
   at cyclically alternating temperatures of 3 similar to 15 degrees C, and
   in seedling emergence in growing trays (67 cells each) in a greenhouse.
   However, seedling emergence was over 2-fold to 4-fold lower in an open
   nursery than in the greenhouse. After sowing in the nursery, secondary
   dormancy was probably induced, because some seeds germinated in the
   following year. Some very young, 2-year-old seedlings started to produce
   male or rarely female cones. This study also showed that soil conditions
   of mother plants can influence the pattern of seed germination and
   seedling emergence.

   percentage) and germination rate of loquat seeds in order to increase
   seedling production in nurseries (applied research) as well as provide
   answers for important physiological issues related to loquat seeds and
   their seed coat (basic research). Three experiments were carried out
   with various pre-sowing treatments. These treatments included full or
   partial removal of seed coat (perisperm), partial cutting of cotyledons
   as well as moist chilling at 5 degrees C for 13 days and/or soaking the
   seeds in water or 250 ppm gibberellic acid (GA(3)) solution for 24 h.
   According to the results, cotyledons excision resulted in delayed
   germination, regardless of the presence or absence of the seed coat in
   comparison with the decoated seeds that demonstrated the highest
   germination rate amongst them. In addition, even the partial excision of
   seed coats affected positively both the germinability and the
   germination rate, compared to the control-intact seeds. Furthermore,
   control-intact seeds had a higher germination percentage when exposed to
   moist chilling independently of the application or not of gibberellin;
   while the combination of gibberellin application and moist chilling
   improved both the percentage and the rate of germination of decoated
   seeds. In conclusion, the role of perisperm (seed coat) in the
   germination procedure of loquat seeds seems to be important, indicating
   the existence of seed coat-imposed dormancy on loquat seeds. Finally,
   the existence of a mild endogenous embryo-dormancy on loquat is also
   discussed.

AB The experiment was carried out in the open at the Escuela Tecnica
   Robinsoniana Aragua de Maturin, located in the capital of Piar
   municipality Monagas State in order to evaluate the effect of different
   coffee seed scarification treatments on germination and formation of
   match seedlings. Selected coffee seeds of variety Catuai Red from
   Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Agricolas were used. Washed river
   sand was used as a substrate, it was disinfected with boiling water and
   put in garden type trays 12 x 40 x 15 cm. The three treatments with
   mechanical scarification were without water immersion and immersion for
   24 and 48 hours, all six treatments employing chemical stratification
   with battery acid (Copper (R)) and muriatic acid (Opin (R)) for 10, 20
   and 30 minutes of immersion; moreover, two treatments with immersion in
   water for 24 and 48 hours and the control treatment was the used one for
   coffee producer (without scarification and immersion). The experimental
   design was a randomized complete block with 12 treatments and four
   replications. The experimental unit consisted of 50 seeds. Evaluations
   were carried out at 25, 30, 40 and 50 days after sowing (DAS).
   Treatments where coffee seeds were subjected to mechanical scarification
   and water immersion for 24 and 48 hours showed the highest values of
   germination and formation of match seedlings, in which, it was found
   that over 60% of germination occurred at 25 days and formation of match
   seedlings occurred at 30 DAS. Chemical scarification treatments using
   commercial products with muriatic acid and battery acid did not have any
   advantage in relation to the control.

AB Crataegus from Rosaceae family is a tree that has medical and ornamental
   applications. Seeds of this genus have germination problem and may not
   germinate for 2 to 3 years. There are limited information about
   germination of different species. Therefore, study on germination of
   three native species of Iran Crataegus aminii, C. persica and C.
   babakhanloui is conducted and the most effective treatment was
   determined. To evaluate the germination and breaking seed dormancy of
   three species, an experiment was carried out as a completely randomized
   design with four treatments and three replications. Seeds were imposed
   under physical stimulator treatment, including, scarification and warmth
   followed by cold stratification. Results indicated that in all
   treatments, scarification is effective for permeability to water of seed
   coat and breakage of seed dormancy. Germination rate in treatment 4
   (impose to running water for 24 h, then 3 month warmth, followed by 4.5
   month cold stratification) had the highest rate. The highest percentage
   of germination and vigor were in treatment 3 (sowing the seeds outdoors
   at the beginning of summer). The number of the seeds that have embryo in
   each fruit is determined. More than 80% of fruits have only one embryo.

AB Seeds, which were collected from a Persian walnut (Juglans regia L.)
   tree, were stratified by the following methods in mid-January; (1)
   Direct planting of seeds in the nursery, (2) Outdoor stratification of
   seeds in moist sand, (3) 24-h dip in water followed by outdoor
   stratification of seeds in sand and (4) Two-weeks dip in water (with
   three times replacing of water). Germination rate of seeds by these
   methods was 80, 85, 88 and 95%, respectively. Although all the used
   methods led to high germination rate but last method which considered as
   an innovated procedure was more convenient in commercial level.
   Moreover, seeds germinated 20 days earlier and seedlings had stronger
   growth in late season using this method. Advantages and disadvantages of
   each method will be discussed in this article.

AB Stratification, chilling, and heat requirements for both seeds and buds
   of five Persian walnut genotypes were compared. In experiments carried
   out between November 2006 and March 2008, 1-year-old twigs were
   collected after leaf-fall, placed in plastic bags, and kept at 4 +/- 1
   degrees C to provide chilling periods ranging from 400 to 1500 h. After
   chilling, twigs were transferred to a greenhouse for determination of
   chilling requirement and the number of growing degree hours (degrees C)
   needed for bud break. For germination experiments, mature seeds were
   stratified at 4 +/- 1 degrees C for treatment periods ranging from 0 to
   8 weeks and then grown in a greenhouse under natural conditions.
   Germination rate and time to radicle emergence were recorded weekly and
   seedling heights were recorded after 2 months growth. Results indicated
   genotypes could be classified into three dormancy groups based on their
   chilling and heat requirements: low ('Ronde de Montignac' and 'Serr'),
   medium ('Z(53)'), and high ('Lara' and 'Z(63)') dormancy. Stratification
   for 6-8 weeks was most appropriate to overcome walnut seed dormancy, to
   obtain the best germination percentage and germination rate, and to
   prevent physiological dwarfing. A relationship between the chilling and
   heat requirements for bud-break and the stratification requirement for
   germination of seeds was observed and data showed that the nutshell is a
   mechanical barrier to germination in walnut seeds with intermediate
   physiological dormancy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Germination and seedling establishment are vulnerable stages in the
   plant life cycle. We investigated how seed mass and family (progeny
   origin) affect germination and juvenile performance in the grassland
   herb Knautia arvensis. Seeds were produced by cross-pollination by hand.
   The fate of 15 individually weighed seeds from each of 15 plants was
   followed during a 3-month growth chamber experiment. Progeny origin
   affected germination, both through seed mass and as an independent
   factor. Two groups of progenies could be distinguished by having rapid
   or delayed germination. The two groups had similar mean seed masses, but
   a positive relationship between seed mass and germination rate could be
   established only among the rapidly germinating progenies. These
   biologically relevant patterns were revealed because timing of
   germination was taken into account in the analyses, not only
   frequencies. Time-to-event data were analysed with failure-time methods,
   which gave more stable estimates for the relation between germination
   and seed mass than the commonly applied logistic regression. Progeny
   origin and seed mass exerted less impact on later characters like
   juvenile survival, juvenile biomass, and rosette number. These
   characters were not affected by the timing of germination under the
   competition-free study conditions. The decrease in the effect of progeny
   origin from the seed and germination to the juvenile stages suggests
   that parental effects other than those contributing to the offspring
   genotype strongly influenced the offspring phenotype at the earliest
   life stages. Further, the division of progeny germination patterns into
   two fairly distinct groups indicates that there was a genetic basis for
   the variation in stratification requirements among parental plants.
   Field studies are needed to elucidate effects of different timing of
   germination in the seasonal grasslands that K. arvensis inhabits. (C)

AB A good working knowledge of seed germination requirements is important
   for plant establishment for restoration and experimentation,
   particularly in wild plant species. Some seeds require a period of
   after-ripening and cold stratification before germination will occur. In
   this study we examined the effects of after-ripening and stratification
   time on seeds from three disjunct populations of Arabidopsis lyrata ssp.
   lyrata, from serpentine and limestone sand substrates of the
   Mid-Atlantic region of the United States. Differences among populations
   were evaluated through seed germination percentage and rate. Overall
   germination percentage and rate significantly varied by population, with
   seeds from the two serpentine populations having a lower germination
   percentage and rate than seeds from the limestone sand population.
   After-ripening time also significantly affected germination percentage
   and rate, with both measurements generally being the highest in 4 and 8
   month-old seeds. Stratification did not generally alter germination
   percentage compared to the untreated control. However, stratification
   appeared to have the greatest effect on the germination rate of seeds
   that had after-ripened for 4 months, but the number of days of
   stratification required was not consistent across populations or across
   years. The variation observed among the populations of A. lyrata ssp.
   lyrata tested is a starting point for understanding how these
   differences developed and how they contribute to the success of each
   population in its native environment.

AB Malvella sherardiana (L.) Jaub & Spach (Malvaceae) is a perennial
   herbaceous plant listed as Vulnerable in the Red List of threatened
   plant species for Spain. The germination characteristics under
   controlled conditions of light and temperature of M. sherardiana seeds
   were studied. Mechanical scarification, cold stratification, liquid
   nitrogen, freezing, hot water, dry heat, sulphuric acid, soaking in
   distilled water and soaking in gibberellic acid were used as pre-sowing
   treatments applied for enhancing germination. The untreated seeds showed
   a high dormancy at all temperature regimens tested and sulphuric acid
   scarification drastically improved final germination percentage and
   germination rate. Germination of seeds soaked in concentrated sulphuric
   acid arithmetically increased as soaking time increased (from 5 min to 3
   h), but seeds soaked in acid for more than 4 h failed to germinate. The
   application of a gibberellic acid solution (1000 mg l(-1)) increased the
   germination percentages for all tested soaking times in sulphuric acid.
   However, it was only significantly effective for the soaking time of 3
   h. The other pre-sowing treatments resulted in some germination, but
   none resulted in greater germination than sulphuric acid. As embryos are
   fully developed and the seed coat is water permeable, we conclude that
   M. sherardiana seeds present physiological dormancy. The main conclusion
   of the study is that dormancy of M. sherardiana seeds is attributed to
   mechanical restriction of the embryo caused by the tough seed coat. This
   is the first report on germination requirements of the Malvella genus.

AB Plantago albicans L. (Plantaginaceae) is a perennial herbaceous plant
   widely distributed throughout the Mediterranean region. The germination
   requirements (under different controlled conditions of light and
   temperature, and after two pre-sowing treatments) and tolerance to
   osmotic stress (polyethylene glycol, PEG 6000) and salinity (NaCl) of P.
   albicans seeds were studied. Seeds were germinated under constant
   temperatures (5 degrees C, 10 degrees C, 15 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 25
   degrees C and 30 degrees C) and alternating temperature regimes of 20/10
   degrees C and 25/15 degrees C with a 16h/8h light/dark photoperiod. The
   outer layer of seeds become mucilaginous when wetted and the presence of
   mucilage on seeds significantly increased germination percentages at all
   temperatures tested. P. albicans seeds were non-dormant and temperature
   significantly affected germination percentages and germination rate
   (germination velocity expressed as mean germination time, MGT). The
   final germination percentages ranged from 34% to 89% for intact seeds
   (seeds with mucilage) and from 9% to 62% for demucilaged seeds,
   depending on the temperature. Temperatures of 25 degrees C and 25/15
   degrees C gave the highest germination percentages. Light did not affect
   seed germination at both temperature regimes assayed (25 degrees C and
   25/15 degrees C). Germination percentages of seeds soaked for 24h in
   distilled water or in a gibberellic acid (GA(3)) solution were not
   significantly higher than that of untreated seeds. In general, both the
   final germination percentage and germination rate were reduced by
   increasing salinity and PEG concentration. Seeds germinated in up to 35%
   PEG and 300mmol center dot L-1 NaCl. Recovery of germination for seeds
   when transferred to distilled water after being in PEG or salinity
   treatments for 15 days was quite high, suggesting that P. albicans seeds
   are tolerant to osmotic and salt stresses.

AB Changes in germination percentage and germination rate of Polygonum
   persicaria resulting from loss of primary dormancy during chilling of

   increased with increasing loss of dormancy. It was concluded that
   retardation of germination caused by dormancy was not due to dormancy
   release prior to germination, but to retardation of the germination
   process itself. When evaluated in relation to competition between
   sugar-beet and P. persicaria, the effect of dormancy on the germination
   percentage was more important than the effect on germination rate, but
   for an accurate prediction of yield loss, the latter effect cannot be
   neglected.

AB Olive seeds do not germinate promptly when placed under favourable

   the role of temperature in the germination of olive embryos was
   conducted. Naked, unchilled olive embryos (Olea europaea L. cv.
   Chalkidikis), cultured in vitro at 20 degrees C, had a germination
   capacity of 73%, whereas that of embryos which had previously been
   chilled at 10 degrees C for 2 or more weeks reached 96%. Intact seeds
   did not germinate at 20 degrees C unless they had previously been
   subjected to 10 degrees C for 3 or 4 weeks. Embryos chilled while in the
   intact seed and excised just before transfer to 20 degrees C, reacted in
   a similar way to naked embryos, but reached their maximum germination
   capacity after 4 weeks at 10 degrees C. Under constant temperature
   conditions the highest germination percentage of embryos was observed at
   10 and 15 degrees C and the highest germination rate at 15 degrees C,
   while a moderate capacity and rate of germination occurred at 20 degrees
   C, and a very low percentage and rate at 25 and 30 degrees C.
   Prechilling at 10 degrees C did not affect germination at 15 degrees C,
   but improved the percentage and the rate of germination at 20, 25 and 30
   degrees C. The germination percentages of embryos chilled for 1 or 2
   weeks at 10 degrees C and then transferred to 25 degrees C were lower
   than those of similarly chilled embryos transferred to 20 degrees C. The
   chilling effect could not be reversed at 25 degrees C when the embryos

   jabuticaba species (Myrciaria jaboticaba ('Jabuticaba Sabara'),
   Myrciaria cauliflora ('Jabuticaba Acu' or 'Jabuticaba Paulista') and
   Myrciaria peruviana var. trunciflora (Jabuticaba de Cabinho)). The
   experiment was arranged in a complete randomized design, in a 3*2*3
   factorial scheme (species * chilling treatment * temperature), with
   three replications, with each plot consisting of 50 seeds. Constant
   temperatures of 24, 32 and 40°C were used in the experiment, and seed
   samples were either subjected or not subjected to chilling treatment
   (5°C) for 10 days before the germination test. Seed germination was
   carried out in B.O.D. chamber in the dark, and low temperature treatment
   was conducted in a cold room. After 33 days, percentage and rate of
   germination were evaluated. Temperature showed influence on the
   percentage and rate of germination of the three jaboticaba species. The
   best results were obtained under constant temperature of 24°C. The
   chilling pretreatment showed negative effects on germination rate of the
   three species.

AB Seeds germination obtained from ten Moroccan maritime pine populations
   growing in three biogeographic areas were studied under controlled
   photoperiod length and temperature for two pretreatments
   (stratifications at 4 degrees C and imbibition with water), Significant
   differences in germinal potential were noted between batches of seeds.
   Whereas a relative homogeneity of the germinal behavior of various
   batches of seeds with respect to duration 12, 48 and 72 h of imbibition
   was noted. However, the duration of stratification has a differential
   effect on the speed of germination (T50) between populations and even
   within the same population. Correlation between geographical parameters,
   percentage of germination (%G) and T50 shows that longitudinal
   variations explain about 46% and 39% of the variance, respectively.

AB The purpose of the present study was to investigate the dormancy break
   and germination requirements of seeds from the rhamnaceous vine
   Berchemia scandens. The fleshy fruit contains a two-locular stone with
   an endocarp described as 'bony, thickish'. Scarified and non-scarified
   stones increased by about 30-50% in mass during imbibition over a 24-h
   period. The endocarp of the stone does not completely enclose the seeds
   and a soft tissue region is present. This region is the primary area of
   water entrance to the seed, as shown by dye-tracking and by sealing it.
   Freshly matured and overwintered seeds of B. scandens germinated to low
   percentages at all temperatures during 2 weeks of incubation in light,
   and they germinated from moderate to high percentages during 12-14 weeks
   of incubation in light. While cold stratification had a relatively
   modest effect on the promotion of total germination across most
   temperatures assessed (if seeds were left for long enough), it had a
   somewhat stronger effect on germination rate. Cold-stratified seeds
   germinated equally well in light and darkness. The class of dormancy
   found in seeds of B. scandens would be physiological. The anatomy of the
   stones readily allows water imbibition, showing that seeds of B.
   scandens lack physical dormancy, an uncommon trait in Rhamnaceae.

AB 1. Restoration of coastal-shingle vegetation at Sizewell, Suffolk, UK,
   after construction of a power station, was underpinned by an
   investigation into the germination ecology of six key species: Crambe
   maritima, Eryngium maritimum, Glaucium flavum, Honckenya peploides,
   Lathyrus japonicus and Rumex crispus. The use of indigenous seed,
   collected from the site before the 6-year construction project,
   necessitated long-term storage. The effects of seed ageing on viability
   and germination responses to temperature, light and salinity were
   examined to determine how any reduction in germination might be
   mitigated.
   2. Innate seed dormancy was important in all species, except R. crispus.
   C. maritima and L. japonicus showed hard-seed dormancy. Stratification
   of E. maritimum, G. flavum and H. peploides effectively softened the
   pericarp or testa, and satisfied their varying requirements for low
   temperature to overcome physiological dormancy.
   3. All species germinated well in diurnally alternating temperature
   regimes. Germination of H. peploides was promoted by light, but the
   other species were insensitive to light. Increasing salinity
   progressively reduced germination rate relative to that in distilled
   water, and sea water at concentrations of 50% or more completely
   inhibited germination.
   4. Seed storage at low temperature and humidity for 7 years did not
   affect innate dormancy, except in H. peploides, where the requirement
   for stratification was lost. Storage reduced germination rate in all
   species, except R. crispus. Ageing resulted in considerably less
   germination at higher temperatures in some species. Salinity-enforced
   dormancy was significantly greater in aged seed for four of the species.
   The promotion of germination by light in H. peploides disappeared with
   age. These changes represented a narrowing of the environmental
   conditions that allow germination, even when viability only declined
   slightly.
   5. Innate dormancy among shingle species and the use of stored seed,
   with high viability, but stringent germination requirements, are likely
   to result in poor and erratic germination. The use of appropriate
   pretreatments to overcome dormancy and optimal conditions for
   germination should allow the efficient use of seed for plant production
   in restoration projects.

AB Manglietia crassipes, a critically endangered species narrowly
   distributed on Mount Dayao in Guangxi, China, is also a species of
   ornamental interest whose variability has not been explored. Key factors
   leading to its endangerment have also not been studied. Here, two
   experiments were conducted to test the effects of different plant growth
   regulators and different storage conditions on germination
   characteristics of M. crassipes seeds. Fruit morphology was measured,
   and germination characteristics of fresh mature seeds were tested in
   order to assess natural seed vigor. Seeds were soaked in distilled water
   (control), or gibberellic acid (GA(3)), 6-benzylaminopurine (6-BA) or
   indoleacetic acid (IAA) solutions of different concentrations, for 48 h
   to determine their effects on seed germination. In addition, the effects
   of different seed storage conditions (constant 4 degrees C, -7 degrees
   C, -20 degrees C, or 25 degrees C for 100 days, wet stratification at 4
   degrees C for 100 days) on seed germination were investigated. Results
   showed that the abortive rate of the mature fruits was high (28.9%) and
   fresh natural seeds had a low germination rate (G) and germination index
   (GI). Seed germination was inhibited with 6-BA at all concentrations,
   but only at less than 100 m center dot L--(1) IAA; otherwise, IAA
   slightly promoted seed germination. GA(3) broke seed dormancy and
   significantly accelerated seed germination by improving G, GI and
   initial germination time (IGT), especially over 2500 mg center dot
   L--(1). The viability of seeds declined no matter how they were stored.
   However, 4 degrees C wet stratification storage was preferable for seed
   vigor and germination power. Our results suggest that the high abortive
   rate of fruits, low germination of the natural seed, seed dormancy and
   its intolerance to storage, contributed to the endangerment of M.
   crassipes. GA(3) can break M. crassipes seed dormancy, which can be a
   benefit for future ornamental breeding and further protection or
   conservation.

AB In order to determine the cause of seed dormancy and the method for

   the seed permeability, the biological inhibition of seed extract, the
   effect of seed germination and the seed germination at different
   temperatures. The results showed that the water permeability of seed
   coat in Pterocarya stenophylla was good. There was germination
   inhibiting substances in the extract of Pterocarya stenoptera seeds, and
   the inhibitory substances may be the main cause of seed dormancy.
   Outdoor overwinter burying and outdoor stratification with snow had no
   obvious effect on dormancy breaking. Indoor cold stratification to
   remove seed dormancy was better. When cold stratification time reached
   120 days, the germination rate was 89%. The temperature significantly
   affected the seed germination, and the germination ability under 25 °C
   was better than other temperature regimes. In conclusion, the Pterocarya
   stenoptera seed was not physical dormancy but physiological dormancy,
   and 120 days cold stratification was needed to break seed dormancy. The
   best germination temperature for dormancy released seeds was 25 °C.

AB Germination timing strongly affects the probability of seedling survival
   and the conditions for subsequent plant growth and reproduction. For
   alpine species, timing of germination should be restricted to a period
   that ensures seedlings will attain a critical size during the short
   growing season and thus survive winter. Thus, we hypothesized that seeds
   of herbaceous alpine perennials germinate only at the beginning of the
   growing season in spring, when temperatures are low, and the seed
   dormancy mechanism helps synchronize the germination event to the
   beginning of the growing season.
   Seed traits and effects of light, temperature, cold stratification and
   GA(3) on germination of Primula alpicola and Pedicularis fletcheri were
   tested in the laboratory and germination responses to temperature of
   seeds buried in the field at 4500 m a.s.l. and exhumed over a 2-year
   period were investigated.
   Fresh seeds were dormant, and cold stratification and GA(3) overcame
   dormancy in seeds of both species and the light requirement for
   germination of P. alpicola seeds. Buried seeds of both species exhibited
   an annual dormancy/nondormancy/dormancy cycle.
   Seeds of P. alpicola and P. fletcheri have nondeep physiological
   dormancy and dormancy cycling. Dormancy cycling was coordinated with
   seasonal environmental conditions, and seeds germinated soon after
   snowmelt in late spring. This is the first comprehensive demonstration
   of regulation of germination timing by dormancy cycling in alpine
   plants.

   methods were investigated and the effects of temperature, illumination
   and seed beds on germination were determined as well as the standard
   germination test method. The 1000-seed weight of A. mongolica was
   371.7-403.9g. The results showed that causes of A. mongolica seed
   dormancy included delayed-ripening physiology and seed coat disorder
   (about 10%). Breaking dormancy measures was 72h treatment under 35°C
   after mechanically breaking peel. The highest germination rate of 98%
   was obtained by removing the seeds after ripening treatment. The kernel
   of high temperature after-ripening and low temperature (2 to 5°C)
   stratification treatments could significantly improve the seed vigour
   (P<0.01), and treatment of different temperatures from 5 to 10°C
   stratifications could significantly increase germination rate and
   vitality (P<0.01). A. mongolica seed dormancy was shallow, and the
   optimum germination temperature was 20 or 10/20°C, as well as the best
   optimum germination bed of the surface of paper, middle papers, paper
   rolls, surface sand or l cm in sand. The seeds were insensitive to

AB The storage condition of plant seeds after their dispersal is critical
   to the seed germination. This paper studied the effects of four storage
   conditions (dry-stored at room temperature, and placed on litter,
   covered with litter, and covered with soil in winter) on the seed
   germination of four Solanaceae species (Lycium ruthenicumr,, L. barbarum
   var. auranticarpum, Solanum alatum, and Darura stramonium) in Hexi
   Corridor, aimed to better understand the seed germination
   characteristics of these species and how these species adapting to their
   habitats. Covering seeds with soil (1 cm) and litter in winter could
   significantly increase the germination percentage of L. ruthenicumr and
   L. barbarum var. auranticarpum seeds up to 96.5% and 75.5%, and 65.3%
   and 53.7%, respectively, and accelerate the germination. In the
   meantime, the non-germinated seeds of L. ruthenicumr and L. barbarum
   var. auranticarpum could still keep higher viability. Placing on litter
   in winter and dry-storing at room temperature could increase the
   germination percentage of L. ruthenicumr seeds by 57.5%, while the
   non-germinated seeds could loss their viability by 47.5% and 31%,
   respectively. Placing on litter in winter made the germination
   percentage of L. barbarum var. auranticarpum seeds being 39.3%, and
   partial non-germinated seeds (38%) lost their viability. After stored
   under the four storage conditions, the germination percentage of S.
   alatum seeds was more than 90% while that of D. stramonium seeds was
   less than 10%, but the non-germinated seeds of D. stramonium still kept
   50.5%-81.5% viability. Both L. ruthenicumr and L. barbarum var.
   auranticarpum displayed the consistency in the responses of seed
   germination to various storage conditions, i. e., the seeds of the two
   species under soil- and litter cover in winter had a significantly
   higher germination percentage, the germination was accelerated, and the
   germination duration was shortened, as compared with those under placed
   on litter in winter or dry-stored at room temperature, which indicated
   that covering seeds with soil and litter in winter could break the
   dominancy of L. ruthenicumr and L. barbarum var. auranticarpum seeds and
   keep their viability, whereas the cold-dry environment in winter could
   make some seeds lost their viability, being unfavorable for the
   establishment and natural regeneration of population. The demand of seed
   germination to cold-wet environment reflected the natural mechanisms of
   reproducing race of temperate plants, which ensured the maximization of
   seedling survival and population establishment.

AB Aims We investigated seed germination of eight desert plant species of
   the Hexi Corridor of China following cold-wet stratification and dry
   storage at room temperature to better understand seed germination and
   dormancy characteristics and how these species are adapted to their
   habitat.Methods Seed viability and initial germination percentage of
   Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Sphaerophysa salsula, Peganum multisectum,
   Zygophyllum fabago, Nitraria tangutorum, Lycium ruthenicum, Salsola
   ruthenica and Asterothamnus centrali-asiaticus were determined. Then
   seeds of these species were divided into four groups (I, II, III and IV)
   and stored in a refrigerator ((4 +/- 1) degrees C, moist), cold room in
   winter ((-5 +/- 1) degrees C, moist), outdoor in winter ((-26 - 10)
   degrees C, moist) and room temperature ((20 +/- 1) degrees C, dry) for
   60 d. Germination was determined under a constant (20 degrees C) and an
   alternating temperature regime (25 degrees C / 10 degrees C) with 12 h
   photoperiod (light/dark) for 30 d. Two main germination indices
   including germination percentage and T50 (half germination time) were
   recorded. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and the least significant
   difference test (LSD) at 5% level.Important findings There were three
   types of seed responses to cold-wet stratification: germination
   percentage increased, no change, or decreased. Germination percentage of
   seeds of P. multisectum and Z. fabago significantly increased following
   cold-wet stratification of 4 degrees C and -5 degrees C, and partially
   increased following -26 - 10 degrees C. Germination percentage of seeds
   of L. ruthenicum significantly increased following 4 degrees C, -5
   degrees C, -26 - 10 degrees C and dry storage at room temperature, with
   germination of 90%-100%. Seeds of P. multisectum, Z. fabago and L.
   ruthenicum have slight physiological dormancy. Germination of seeds of
   N. tangutorum, G. uralensis and Sphaerophysa salsula slightly changed
   following three cold-wet stratification. Seeds of Salsola ruthenica with
   non-dormancy (germinated to 84% before storage) decreased their
   germination following cold-wet stratification of 4 degrees C, whereas no
   change occurred at -5 degrees C, -26 - 10 degrees C. In addition, the
   response of germination to incubation temperature varied with species.

AB The seed germination responses of Lycium chinense, L. ruthenium,

   examined after stored in a cold room (-5 degrees C, moist) during
   winter, in a refrigerator (4 degrees C, moist) for 65 clays, and at room
   temperature (20 degrees C, dry) for 6 months. The seeds of L. barbarum,
   L. ruthenicum, and H. scorpaium after stored moist at -5 degrees C and 4
   degrees C had higher germination percentage and rate, and an earlier
   time to the onset of germination, compared with those stored dry at room
   temperature. The germination percentage of L. ruthenicum seeds was 80%
   after stored moist in the cold room and in the refrigerator, and only 5%
   after stored dry at room temperature. 88% and 65% of H. scorpaium seeds
   germinated after stored moist in the cold room and in the refrigerator,
   respectively, and 40% of them germinated after stored dry at room
   temperature. L. barbarum seeds had a germination percentage of 68% after
   stored moist in the cold room, but of less than 20% after stored humid
   in the refrigerator and at room temperature. Storage condition had no
   significant effects on the seed germination of N. sphaerocarpa, and the
   maximum germination percentage in all storage treatments ranged from 18%
   to 27%. Therefore, cold stratification (-5 degrees C and 4 degrees C)
   could be an efficient method to break the seed dormancy for L. barbarum,
   L. ruthenium, and H. scorpaium, but not for N. sphaerocarpa.

AB Iva xanthiifolia is an alien invasive plant species, with serious threat
   to biodiversity in Northeast China. In this study, we measured the
   1000-grain weight, water content, germination indices and endogenous
   gibberellin levels of seeds collected in different years. To elucidate
   the germination characteristics of Iva xanthiifolia seeds and their
   roles in invasion, we explored the effects of photoperiod, cold
   stratification time, and freezing stress on seed germination and
   seedling growth with seeds collected in 2019. Results showed that the
   1000-grain weight of seeds collected in different years was 1.172-1.311
   g, water content was 0.93%-1.26%, and germination rate and endogenous
   gibberellin content were decreased significantly with the increasing
   storage time. Iva xanthiifolia seeds required light for germination. The
   germination rate tended to increase significantly with the duration of
   light exposure. However, light treatment significantly inhibited
   seedling hypocotyl elongation. With the time extension of cold
   stratification at 4 degrees C, there was an initial increase and then a
   decreasing trend for seed germination characteristics. The highest
   germination rate of 68.3% was obtained after 15 d of treatment.
   Germination rate, endogenous gibberellin content of seeds, fresh weight
   of seedlings were significantly reduced by freezing treatment at -20
   degrees C and -40 degrees C, but the hypocotyl length of seedlings was
   not significantly affected. Our results showed that deep ploughing
   before sowing would be an effective measure for field control of Iva
   xanthiifolia.

AB In semi-arid regions of the Loess Plateau, water deficiency restricts
   plant performance. Panicum virgatum (switchgrass), which is a highly
   versatile grass, had been introduced to the Plateau as a restoration
   species. To determine if prechilling stratification (PCS) and sulfuric
   acid scarification (SAS) can optimize establishment, P. virgatum cvs
   Pathfinder, Trailblazer and Alamo were tested under different ambient
   water potentials by measuring germination and root and shoot growth
   along water potential gradients under laboratory conditions. Both PCS
   and SAS improved total germination percentage (TGP), with PCS being more
   beneficial. The effect of PCS and SAS on mean germination time (MGT)
   weakened gradually with increasing drought stress. Both PCS and SAS
   showed no obvious effect on promoting root and shoot growth. Both PCS
   and SAS reduced base water potential requirement for reaching 50%
   germination of Pathfinder and Trailblazer, with this effect greater for
   PCS. These results indicate that embryo dormancy may be a major factor
   limiting germination of P. virgatum under drought conditions. Pathfinder
   appears to be more suitable for a semi-arid environment, whereas Alamo
   appears to be unsuitable for drought conditions. Given the large
   difference between predicted value and measured value, the reliability
   and applicable scope of linear regression estimated Psi(50) needs
   further investigation, specification and optimization.

AB R. rosea has been widely used as traditional herb medicine in China for
   centuries. Its seeds germinate unevenly and at a low rate; this is due
   to seed dormancy. Pre-chill treatment and exogenous plant hormone
   stimulation were used to break the dormancy of R. rosea seeds, to
   trigger seed germination and to gain high quality seedlings, as well as
   to determine the physiological interactions between exogenous
   stimulation, endogenous plant hormone change, seed germination and
   seedling growth. Seeds pre-chilled at 4°C for 3 weeks showed the highest
   germination rate (482%) at 25-10°C. In the embryos of seeds, the
   endogenous level of abscisic acid decreased and then maintained at low
   level after being treated with exogenous gibberellic acid (GA3), 2,4-D
   and GA3+2,4-D. Medium level of endogenous IAA (494.6-611.8 ng/g fresh
   weight) could balance the growth of root and shoot and increase the
   survival rate of seedlings.

AB The C-repeat binding factors (CBFs)/dehydration-responsive
   element-binding protein (DREBs) are a group of conserved transcription
   factors, with fundamental roles in response and adaptation to cold
   stress in plants, especially chilling-tolerant and herbal species.
   However, the information on CBFs in chilling-sensitive woody plants is
   relatively limited. Previously, we performed the global transcriptome
   sequencing of chilling-treated Jatropha curcas L., an important
   chilling-sensitive bioenergy woody crop. A novel CBF-like gene,
   designated JcCBF, was isolated, which contains AP2/EREBPmotifknown to
   exist in all other plant CBFs. Thephylogenetic analysis for CBF homologs
   of plants clearly divided data into two groups, and JcCBF was closely
   related to CBF fromHordeum vulgare. Analysis of its promoter region
   identified threepossible MYC permutation sequences of theCANNTG core,
   implying its transcriptional regulation driven by an upstreamfactor
   termed as the inducer of CBF expression 1 (ICE1). No obvious
   morphologicdifferences were observed between the WT and the transgenic
   tobacco with JcCBF over expression, under normal growth conditions,
   while the transgenic seeds exhibited a higher germination rate and
   survival ability when grown under a lower temperature (16 degrees C). T2
   generation of transgenic tobacco will be subjected to unraveling the
   molecular mechanism of increased chilling tolerance in future.

AB The effect of stratification on dormancy release of grape seeds crossing
   from the sub- to the supraoptimal range of temperatures and water
   contents was analysed by modified threshold models. The stratification
   impacted on dormancy release in three different ways: (i) dormancy was
   consistently released with prolonged stratification time when stratified
   at temperatures of < 15 degrees C; (ii) at 15 degrees C and 20 degrees
   C, the stratification effect initially increased, and then decreased
   with extended time; and (iii) stratification at 25 degrees C only
   reduced germinable seeds. These behaviours indicated that stratification
   could not only release primary dormancy but also induce secondary
   dormancy in grape seed. The rate of dormancy release changed linearly in
   two phases, while induction increased exponentially with increasing
   temperature. The thermal time approaches effectively quantified dormancy
   release only at suboptimal temperature, but a quantitative method to
   integrate the occurrence of dormancy release and induction at the same
   time could describe it well at either sub- or supraoptimal temperatures.
   The regression with the percentage of germinable seeds versus
   stratification temperature or water content within both the sub- and
   supraoptimal range revealed how the optimal temperature (T-so) and water
   content (W-so) for stratification changed. The T-so moved from 10.6
   degrees C to 5.3 degrees C with prolonged time, while W-so declined from
   > 0.40 g H2O g DW-1 at 5 degrees C to similar to 0.23 g H2O g DW-1 at 30
   degrees C. Dormancy release in grape seeds can occur across a very wide
   range of conditions, which has important implications for their ability
   to adapt to a changeable environment in the wild.

   germination. The germination rates of six alfalfa cultivars were studied
   comparatively at 10A degrees C. Xinmu No. 1 and Northstar were selected
   as chilling stress-tolerant and stress-sensitive cultivars for further
   characterization. After chilling treatment, Xinmu No. 1 showed higher
   seedling growth than Northstar. Xinmu No. 1 exhibited low levels of
   hydrogen peroxide and lipid peroxidation compared with Northstar. In
   addition, shoots in Xinmu No. 1 treated with chilling showed higher
   activities of the superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and
   catalase than those of Northstar, whereas Xinmu No. 1 showed higher APX
   activity in roots that Northstar. These results indicated that high
   antioxidation activity in Xinmu No. 1 under chilling stress is well
   associated with tolerance to chilling condition during germination.

AB Low temperature is an environmental stress factor that is always been
   applied in research on improving crop growth, productivity, and quality
   of crops. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play an important role in
   cold tolerance, so its genetic manipulation of the PUFA contents in
   crops has led to the modification of cold sensitivity. In this study, we
   over-expressed an omega-3 fatty acid desaturase from Glycine max
   (GmFAD3A) drove by a maize ubiquitin promoter in rice. Compared to the
   wild type (ZH11), ectopic expression of GmFAD3A increased the contents
   of lipids and total PUFAs. Seed germination rates in GmFAD3A transgenic
   rice were enhanced under low temperature (15 degrees C). Moreover, cold
   tolerance and survival ratio were significantly improved in GmFAD3A
   transgenic seedlings. Malondialdehyde (MDA) content in GmFAD3A
   transgenic rice was lower than that in WT under cold stress, while
   proline content obviously increased. Meanwhile, the activities of
   superoxide dismutase (SOD), hydroperoxidase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD)
   increased substantially in GmFAD3A transgenic rice after 4 h of cold
   treatment. Taken together, our results suggest that GmFAD3A can enhances
   cold tolerance and the seed germination rate at a low temperature in
   rice through the accumulation of proline content, the synergistic
   increase of the antioxidant enzymes activity, which finally ameliorated
   the oxidative damage.

AB Cherry (Cerasus Mill.) species are important agricultural crops with
   high economic and ornamental values. The seeds of stone fruits have a
   long dormancy period after harvest, which cannot germinate and grow
   until the dormancy has been broken. In order to break the dormancy and
   speed up the gremination of cherry seeds, we studuied the effect of
   GA(3) treatment on the dormancy-breaking and germination rate of Chinese
   cherry and sweet cherry seeds without cold stratification. The results
   showed that GA(3) treatment significantly increased the germination
   rates of cherry seeds, reaching the maximum value of 64%, 24% and 40% at
   the concentration of 100 mg.L-1 of GA(3) for cultivated and wild Chinese
   cherry, and sweet cherry. In addition, GA(3) treatment obviously speed
   up the germination index of cherry seeds, reaching the maximum value
   when immersing seeds with 100 mg.L-1 of GA(3). Therefore, it is
   necessary to cultivate cherry seedlings by GA(3) treatment.

AB We analyzed changes in abscisic acid (ABA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA),
   Gibberellin A(3)(GA(3)), and trans-Zeatin-riboside (ZR) content in seeds
   of Idesia polycarpa Maxim. Plant hormones have been widely studied for
   their roles in the regulation of various aspects related to plant
   development and, in particular, into their action during seed dormancy
   release. The obtained evidence suggest that the functions of these
   hormones are not restricted to a particular development stage, and that
   more than one hormone is involved in controlling various aspects of
   plant development. Our results will contribute to understanding the role
   of these hormones during seed dormancy release in Idesia polycarpa
   Maxim. The contents and balance of endogenous hormones in I. Polycarpa
   seeds changed during the chilling treatment. The contents of IAA, GA(3),
   and ZR and the dynamic ratios of hormones were higher in the chilling
   treatment than in the control. The ABA content was lower than in the
   control. The chilling treatment released seed dormancy and significantly
   improved the seed germination rate. The germination rate was

AB Objective: This study investigated the relationship between the dynamic
   changes of endogenous hormones and seeds germination after dormancy
   release to provide a basis for clarifying the mechanism of seed
   germination of Idesia polycarpa, and to provide a theoretical basis and
   technical support for the breeding and application of I. polycarpa.
   Method: The endogenous hormones contents of I. polycarpa seeds from
   Jiyuan provenance were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
   Result: (1) Under the constant temperature of 25°C, the seeds
   germination rate of I. polycarpa was less than 10%; Under the variable
   temperature condition of 15°C/25°C, the germination rate of the seeds
   without prechilling treatment was 33%-37%; With the extension of the
   chilling treatment time at 5°C, the germination rate increased
   gradually, and the germination rate reached to 98.0% in 60 d. (2) Under
   the variable temperature condition of 15°C/25°C, IAA, GA3 and ZR
   contents were significantly higher than that under the constant
   temperature of 25°C. However the ABA content was just the opposite, and
   the ratio of (IAA+GA3+ZR)/ABA and GA3/ABA became larger. (3) Under the
   variable temperature condition, IAA and ABA contents showed a decreasing
   trend, while GA3 and ZR contents first increased and then decreased
   during the germination process of seeds without prechilling treatment.
   But the contents of IAA, GA3 and ZR in seeds prechilled all increased
   first and then decreased except for ABA, the difference was only the
   time of peak appearance. (4) With the increase of prechilling time, the
   (IAA+GA3+ZR)/ABA and GA3/ABA ratios increased first, respectively
   reached to 3.80.2, 2.00.1, and then decreased during the germination
   process, but time reaching the peak was different among different
   periods of prechilling, the peak time of prechilling treatment for 0,
   20, 40 d and 60 d was at 20, 12, 12 d and 8 d, respectively. (5) There
   was no consistent correlation between the seeds germination rate and the
   single endogenous hormone among the prechilling periods, but the
   germination rate was significantly correlated with ratios of
   (IAA+GA3+ZR)/ABA and GA3/ABA. Conclusion: The seeds of Idesia polycarpa
   from Jiyuan provenance have obvious dormancy characteristics. Under the
   variable temperature condition, experiencing the chilling treatment time
   at 5°C, the earlier the (IAA+GA3+ZR)/ABA and GA3/ABA ratios in seeds
   reached to peak, the higher the germination rate was. When the peak time
   of the ratios was shortened to 8 d, the germination rate was the
   highest. The effect of prechilling on dormancy release is to reach the
   equilibrium state of endogenous hormones early in the germination
   process.

   germination at 13°C and the chilling-tolerant lines could be further
   distinguished at 13°C. The chilling-tolerant lines germinated best at
   13-15°C. The breeding lines were classified into three groups according
   to the time of peak peroxidase activity. The lines that had an earlier
   peak had a higher germination rate at the low temperature than the lines
   that had a late peak. In addition, complex changes in peroxidase
   isoenzyme profiles occurred during germination, and the number of
   isoenzyme bands and their intensities were reduced by low temperature.

AB Intraspecific recurrent selection in V. vinifera is an effective method
   for breeding of high quality, disease-, cold-, and drought-resistance
   grapes. Exploring the optimal treatment methods for grape (V. vinifera)
   seeds can help to accelerate the process of intraspecific recurrent
   selection and improve breeding efficiency. In this study, seeds of six
   V. vinifera varieties were used as experimental materials, and the
   germination and seedling formation characteristics were studied by
   single factor treatment and orthogonal compound treatment, respectively.
   To do this, stratification, chemical substances, beak cutting, and
   pre-germination treatments were tested, and the optimal treatment
   combination was determined for each variety. The results indicated that
   the optimal conditions obtained in the orthogonal experiments were not
   completely consistent with those in the single-factor experiments.
   Single factor experiment results demonstrated that two stratification
   methods (chilling gauze-storage and chilling sand-storage) and two
   pre-germination methods (pre-germination in petri dishes and
   pre-germination in a bean sprouter) vary in effectiveness for different
   varieties. gibberellin acid (GA(3)) soaking and beak-cutting promote the
   germination and seedling rate of the tested varieties. Orthogonal test
   results demonstrate that, for Dunkelfelder and Cabernet Sauvignon, the
   optimal treatment combination was chilling sand-storage + GA(3) soaking
   seed + beak cutting + pre-germination in petri dishes. For Meili, the
   optimal treatment combination was chilling sand-storage + acetic acid
   (HAc) soaking seed + beak cutting + pre-germination in petri dishes. For
   Ecolly, the optimal treatment combination was chilling sand-storage +
   GA(3) soaking seed + beak cutting + pre-germination in a bean sprouter.
   For Garanior, the optimal treatment combination was chilling
   sand-storage + HAc soaking seed + no beak cutting + pre-germination in
   petri dishes. For Marselan, the optimal treatment combination was
   chilling gauze-storage + GA(3) soaking seed + beak cutting +
   pre-germination in a bean sprouter. This study identified the optimal
   conditions for seed germination and seedling formation of six grape
   varieties, which will facilitate future work to characterize the seed
   germination and seedling formation of seeds obtained by intraspecific
   hybridization of these varieties. This work also provides a reference
   for addressing problems of low seed germination rate and suboptimal
   seedling formation for better utilization of grape germplasms.

   choice mechanism of the seeds. Almost all the newly collected seeds were
   non-dormant. Under constant temperature conditions, maximum percentage
   germination (approximately 90%) was attained at temperatures
   6-16.degree. C, where simple linear relationships were observed between
   the temperature and the rates of germination, i.e. the reciprocals of
   the time  taken to germinate by seed subpopulations with 10-80%
   germination. Thermal time required for germination of the subpopulations
   ranged from 600 Kh (degree Kelvin .times. hours) to 1500 Kh with a
   relatively constant base temperature of about 2.5.degree. C. Lower limit
   temperature for germination was slightly below 6.degree. C. Higher limit
   temperature for germination has the normal distribution with the mean
   .+-. SD of 19 .+-. 2.5.degree. C. Pre-exposure of imbibed seeds to
   temperatures higher than the higher limit temperature for germination,
   25 and 30.degree. C, had no effect on the germinability and the rate of
   germination at a circa-optimum temperature. Moist chilling treatment at
   4.degree. C caused an increase in the variation of germination rate
   within the seed population, but no evidence for dormancy-inducing or
   breaking effects was obtained.

AB Laboratory and field experiments were conducted to determine the effects
   of several environmental factors on seed germination and seedling
   emergence of the invasive weed, apple of Peru. The anatomy of the seed
   was also investigated in this study. The anatomy of the seed is similar
   to that of an eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) seed. The seed is
   albuminous, and consists of a seed coat, endosperm, and an embryo. The
   seed coat, which consists of both outer and inner integuments, is
   relatively thick. Fresh and dry stored seeds exhibited strong dormancy.
   Hot water treatment did not affect the seed germination in the light,
   but significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the germination rate in the dark.
   Dry-heat treatment had no significant effect on seed germination in the
   dark, but it significantly (P < 0.05) increased the germination rate in
   the light. Cold stratification alone did not influence seed germination
   under constant temperature (25 C) but affected it under alternating
   temperature (25-15 C). However, a combination of warm and cold
   stratification produced significant (P < 0.05) germination in the dark
   as well as in the light. In addition, the effect of warm stratification
   followed by cold stratification was more pronounced in the dark than in
   the light. Gibberellin A(3) (GA(3)) (10(-3); and 10(-4) M) treatments
   significantly (P < 0.05) increased the seed germination rate compared
   with that of the control. Emergence rate was maximum for seeds placed on
   the soil surfaces; no seedling emergence occurred when seeds were placed
   at a depth of 5 cm.

AB The importance of plantation forests in the conservation of endangered
   species has increased over time. Rhododendron uwaense is a small,
   endangered, evergreen broadleaf tree first described in 1984. This
   species only occurs in plantations and secondary forests on a small
   watershed in Shikoku, western Japan. Between the first observation of
   the species and 2017 no forest management practices had been conducted
   within the species' range; however, the landowner began thinning
   operations in 2017. If this species has light requirements for
   germination as like some Rhododendron species, forest management
   practices that improve light availability may facilitate the
   establishment of the species. To reveal the germination characteristics
   and the appropriate storage conditions and length for R. uwaense seeds,
   we assessed differences in the germination of seeds stored under
   different conditions (indoor, outdoor, moist chilled and dry chilled)
   and for varying durations (45, 90, 136, 180, 225 days) by the gradually
   increasing and decreasing temperature method. Germination was higher in
   the increasing temperature regime. This trend is common among plant
   species with physiological dormancy that is broken by chilling, allowing
   seeds to germinate in the spring. Seeds that were collected during the
   dispersal period germinated immediately after collection, but
   germination required the presence of light. Seeds stored indoors for
   more than 180 days failed to germinate. Seeds stored dry chilled for 225
   days still maintained a germination rate of more than 60%. Improvement
   of forest floor light conditions and seed storage under dry chilled
   conditions are recommended for seed germination and propagation.

AB Pterocarya fraxinifolia (Poir.) Spach (Juglandaceae) is a model relict
   tree species native to South Caucasus and is a typical element of
   threatened riparian forests. Intensive land transformations, which are
   common in Transcaucasia, have resulted in loss of natural habitat and
   population decline of the species. One of the methods of ex situ
   conservation is seed banking. Cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen (-196
   degrees C) is of particular interest, as it allows safe preservation of
   valuable plant genetic resources. However, the feasibility of seed
   cryopreservation is related to the desiccation tolerance and intrinsic
   composition of the seeds. In this study, we examined the physiological
   traits of Pterocarya fraxinifolia seeds, for which desiccation tolerance
   is unknown or controversial, and their feasibility for cryopreservation.
   Additionally, we tested stratification methods for dormancy assessment.
   Results showed that seeds survived desiccation to a moisture content of
   2.8% with a germination rate of 64%. Stratification at a temperature of
   3 degrees C for 8 weeks proved to be both fast and effective. Seed
   moisture content ranging from 2.8% to 18.1% was determined to be safe
   for cryopreservation. There was no difference in seedling emergence in
   seeds stored for 1 year regardless of the storage temperature (-3, -18,
   or -196 degrees C). Based on our results, Pterocarya fraxinifolia seeds
   can be classified as orthodox. This study demonstrates for the first
   time the feasibility of cryopreserving Pterocarya fraxinifolia seeds.

AB Several North American native wildflowers have potential for medicinal

   priming, of Blue-flag iris (Iris versicolor), evening primrose
   (Oenothera biennis), narrow-leaf purple coneflower (Echinaeea
   angustifolia) and purple coneflower (E. purpurea). Stratification
   consisted of storing seeds in wet paper towels at 4degrees-5degreesC for
   4 weeks (in 1997) or 3 weeks (in 1999). Priming consisted of soaking
   seeds in an aerated 0.1 M or 0.2 M solution of KNO3 for 7 days in 1999;
   in 1997 a 0.1 M solution was used for 5 days. With Iris versicolor
   stratification, priming and the control gave respectively 58%,33% and 9%
   germination in 1997 and 17%, 1% and 0% in 1999; germination was slow and
   took 24-34 days in 1997 and 1219 days in 1999. Germination of Oenothera
   biennis was not significantly affected by stratification or priming.
   With Echinacea angustifolia, stratification, priming and the control
   gave respectively 22%, 24% and 12% germination in 1997; germination was
   much poorer in 1999 and never exceeded 10%; in 1999, stratified seeds
   germinated faster than the other treatments. Both stratification and
   priming improved % germination of E. purpurea from 44% to 83% and 69%
   respectively; these treatments also reduced the time to germination from
   13 days to 8 or 6 days, respectively.

AB INDUCER OF CBF EXPRESSION 1 (ICE1) encodes a MYC-like basic
   helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor playing a critical role in
   plant responses to chilling and freezing stresses and leaf stomata
   development. However, no information connecting ICE1 and reproductive
   development has been reported. In this study, we show that ICE1 controls
   plant male fertility via impacting anther dehydration. The
   loss-of-function mutation in ICE1 gene in Arabidopsis caused anther
   indehiscence and decreased pollen viability as well as germination rate.
   Further analysis revealed that the anthers in the mutant of ICE1
   (ice1-2) had the structure of stomium, though the epidermis did not
   shrink to dehisce. The anther indehiscence and influenced pollen
   viability as well as germination in ice1-2 were due to abnormal anther
   dehydration, for most of anthers dehisced with drought treatment and
   pollen grains from those dehydrated anthers had similar viability and
   germination rates compared with wild type. Accordingly, the sterility of
   ice1-2 could be rescued by ambient dehydration treatments. Likewise, the
   stomatal differentiation of ice1-2 anther epidermis was disrupted in a
   different manner compared with that in leaves. ICE1 specifically bound
   to MYC-recognition elements in the promoter of FAMA, a key regulator of
   guard cell differentiation, to activate FAMA expression. Transcriptome
   profiling in the anther tissues further exhibited ICE1-modulated genes
   associated with water transport and ion exchange in the anther.
   Together, this work reveals the key role of ICE1 in male fertility
   control and establishes a regulatory network mediated by ICE1 for

AB INDUCER OF CBF EXPRESSION 1 (ICE1) encodes a MYC-like basic
   helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor playing a critical role in
   plant responses to chilling and freezing stresses and leaf stomata
   development. However, no information connecting ICE1 and reproductive
   development has been reported. In this study, we show that ICE1 controls
   plant male fertility via impacting anther dehydration. The
   loss-of-function mutation in ICE1 gene in Arabidopsis caused anther
   indehiscence and decreased pollen viability as well as germination rate.
   Further analysis revealed that the anthers in the mutant of ICE1
   (ice1-2) had the structure of stomium, though the epidermis did not
   shrink to dehisce. The anther indehiscence and influenced pollen
   viability as well as germination in ice1-2 were due to abnormal anther
   dehydration, for most of anthers dehisced with drought treatment and
   pollen grains from those dehydrated anthers had similar viability and
   germination rates compared with wild type. Accordingly, the sterility of
   ice1-2 could be rescued by ambient dehydration treatments. Likewise, the
   stomatal differentiation of ice1-2 anther epidermis was disrupted in a
   different manner compared with that in leaves. ICE1 specifically bound
   to MYC-recognition elements in the promoter of FAMA, a key regulator of
   guard cell differentiation, to activate FAMA expression. Transcriptome
   profiling in the anther tissues further exhibited ICE1-modulated genes
   associated with water transport and ion exchange in the anther.
   Together, this work reveals the key role of ICE1 in male fertility
   control and establishes a regulatory network mediated by ICE1 for
   stomata development and water movement in the anther. Copyright: CC BY

AB Dimorphic seeds may help plants to cope with unpredictable environmental
   changes, especially for halophytes. Mature seeds (black and brown) of
   Suaeda salsa inhabiting in the Yuncheng Salt Lake were used to reveal
   adaptive strategies of the halophyte with dimorphic seeds in saline
   habitat by combining laboratory observation and germination experiments.
   The morphology, dormancy and germination characteristics of dimorphic
   seeds were compared. The results showed that: (1) black seeds were small
   and had keratose and glossy testa, while brown seeds were larger and had
   membranous and lusterless testa. (2) Germination of freshly matured
   brown seeds was more than 90% across the experimental temperature
   ranges, while germination of black seeds was only the highest at 15/25°C
   (less than 85%), and brown seeds had higher germination rate than black
   seeds. (3) Alternating of light and darkness or full darkness had no
   significant effect on germination of brown seeds under low salt
   conditions (<0.39 mol/L). However, germination of black seeds under
   light was significantly higher than that under darkness (P<0.05).
   Responses of dimorphic seeds to saline stress were different,
   germination of brown seeds was more than 30% in 0.78 mol/L NaCl
   solution, while black seeds did not germinate beyond 0.59 mol/L. (4)
   Brown seeds were non-dormant, but black seeds had non-deep physiological
   dormancy. Seed coat scarification, dry storage, cold stratification and
   GA3 significantly promoted germination of black seeds. Our study
   revealed that S. salsa adopts "bet-hedging" strategy (differences in
   dormancy and germination behavior of dimorphic seeds) to increase the
   adaptability to the heterogeneous habitat.

AB High germination percentage and rapid germination rate can be an
   indicator of the invasive potential of a plant species. Rhamnus
   cathartica (common buckthorn) and R. frangula (glossy buckthorn) are
   currently classified as exotic invasive species in many areas of North
   America. Currently the landscape industry is using R. frangula
   'Asplenifolia' (cutleaf buckthorn) and R. frangula 'Columnaris'
   (columnar buckthorn) as ornamental landscape plants. Apparently, these
   cultivars have not been investigated for their invasive potential. Seeds
   were locally collected from representative specimens of each
   species/cultivar. Seeds were then extracted from their fleshy matrix and
   coldmoist stratified for 2 months. Following stratification, seeds were
   germinated under a suitable, controlled environment on germination
   blotters in glass petri dishes with a day/night temperature of
   75/65degreeF. A 16-h photoperiod was supplied by fluorescent lamps and
   incandescent bulbs which provided a PPF of apprxeq154
   mumolcntdotm-2cntdots-1. The experimental design was a RCBD with three
   observation per replication and three replications over time with an
   observation consisting of one petri dish containing 100 seeds per
   species/cultivar. Seeds were observed daily and germination was
   recorded. A seed was considered "germinated" when the radicle protruded
   gtoreq 1 mm. This preliminary study indicates that R. frangula
   'Columnaris' had germination percentages comparable to R. frangula
   however, R. frangula 'Asplenifolia' had a substantially lower seed
   germination. Rhamnus cathartica had the highest germination percentage
   when compared to other species and cultivars of Rhamnus. This species is
   commonly known to be the more aggressive of the two recognized invasive
   buckthorns. This study provides evidence to support this belief. These
   results also indicate that R. frangula 'Columnaris' has similar invasive
   potential to R. frangula and R. frangula 'Asplenifolia' is less likely
   to become invasive based on seed germination.

AB The propagation of Ilex paraguariensis A.St.-Hil. is carried out by
   seeds that have a low germination rate and morphophysiological dormancy.
   In order to increase the germination percentage, stratification
   treatments and emergence monitoring were tested. For this, yerba mate
   seeds were subjected to stratification treatments: Treatment 1 - seeds
   between two sand layers; Treatment 2 - seeds between two sand layers and
   commercial substrate covered with corn straw; Treatment 3 - seeds
   between two sand layers with the addition of 4.0 g L-1 of
   controlled-release fertilizer; Treatment 4 - seeds between two sand
   layers covered with corn straw; and a control treatment - seeds without
   stratification. The stratification period for all treatments was 180
   days, and at 120, 150, and 180 days, 100 seeds were removed per
   repetition from each treatment for emergence tests, with weekly
   observation for 180-days in a completely randomized design. After that
   period, the tetrazolium test was performed with the seeds that did not
   emerge. At 120-days of stratification there was no emergence and at
   150-days it was 0.83%. At 180-days, treatment 3 showed the highest
   percentage - 13.19%. Seeds without stratification do not germinate and
   after 180-days of emergence the amount of non-viable seeds increased in
   all treatments. Stratification in sand, combined with controlled-release
   fertilizer favors yerba mate seedlings emergence. After 180-days of
   emergence in germinator plants at 25°C, there is an increase in
   non-viable seeds amount. Seeds that did not undergo the stratification
   process do not germinate and present a higher dormant seeds percentage
   after 180-days of emergence.

AB Ornamental peaches can be propagated from seed. Efficient seed
   treatments for early germination and seedling growth can help to shorten
   nursery and breeding periods. In order to find key genes associated with
   dormancy release, we analyzed the expression of certain genes previously
   found to be related to seed dormancy. Seeds of 'Hokimomo' peach were
   rinsed for 2 or 7 days under running tap water at 15 degrees C and
   chilled at 5 degrees C. Chilling (stratification) for periods of 6 or 8
   weeks were found to be suitable for germination and growth of seedlings
   with resulting heights between 1520 cm at 35 days after sowing. Seeds
   rinsed for 2 days showed a higher germination rate than those rinsed for
   7 days when the chilling period was 6 or 8 weeks. In contrast, the
   germination rate of seed rinsed for 7 days was better than those rinsed
   for 2 days when the chilling period was 4 weeks. In this study, the
   expression of genes NCED1, ABA 8'-hydroxylase and GA2-oxidase tended to
   decrease after seeds were rinsed for 7 days and chilled for 4 weeks.
   Transcript levels of LEA-D34 or dehydrin, a gene that is associated with
   drought stress was significantly higher before seeds were rinsed
   compared to its levels following rinsing and chilling of seeds. Our
   findings provide useful information for understanding the molecular
   mechanism(s) of seed dormancy and the development of methods to shorten
   the breeding period in various ornamental trees.

AB Fluridone, an inhibitor of carotenoid biosynthesis, is known to prevent
   abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis and to affect the germination and
   dormancy of seeds in several plant species. This study investigated the
   effects of fluridone on seed germination of the ornamental peach
   'Yaguchi', and on the transcript levels of genes related to seed
   dormancy in this plant. Seeds were rinsed for 2 days under running tap
   water (RS), then soaked for 1 day in 100 mu M fluridone (F), and kept at
   5 degrees C for 2 weeks (2W). The germination rate significantly
   increased from 0% to 9.5% in the RS+F treatment and to 71.4% in the
   RS+F+2W treatment, while no germination occurred in the RS and RS+2W
   treatments. Seedlings in RS+F and RS+F+2W treatments formed dwarf
   shoots, i.e. about 10 cm, and morphological lesions on the leaves. The
   ABA content in embryonic axes decreased after RS and increased with
   RS+2W. It was decreased by the RS+F+2W treatment. RS+F+2W downregulated
   ABA-hy3, which encodes enzymes with key roles in ABA catabolism, while
   its effects on 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED1) in relation to
   ABA synthesis fluctuated. In contrast, Empfindlicherim Dunkelroten Licht
   1 (EID1) was upregulated after fluridone treatment, suggesting that
   fluridone may activate positive ABA signaling pathways. Expression of
   GA2-oxidase8 (GA2-ox8) was not affected by fluridone. MADS-box protein
   JOINTLESS (LeMADS) and Late embryogenesis abundant protein D-34 (LEA
   D-34) were downregulated in the RS+F+2W treatment, suggesting that the
   expression of these genes are controlled by low temperature and the ABA
   inhibitor, and are involved in seed dormancy. These results suggest that
   ABA inhibitor treatments can be an alternative method to promote
   germination by controlling ABA content and its metabolism, and
   consequently changing expression of certain ABA- and dormancy-related
   genes including ABA-hy3, EID1, LeMADS, and LEA D-34, even under
   insufficient chilling conditions.

AB Kiwifruit industries throughout the world are threatened by the
   bacterial canker caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa).
   Vines of the yellow-fleshed and red-fleshed cultivars seem very
   susceptible and can die shortly after infection. Even green-fleshed
   cultivars can be seriously affected. The best solution is to breed
   Psa-resistant or tolerant cultivars. Using conventional methods, this
   would not only take a long time and require a large planting area for
   screening of response to field infection and selection of resistant
   plants, but could also pose a danger by supplying inoculum which would
   spread the disease. Screening of young plantlets could provide a
   solution - saving time and keeping infected plant material in controlled
   environments. We report the development of a protocol for germinating
   kiwifruit seedlings on agar medium. The usual methods of germinating
   Actinidia seed involve a short cold treatment with a suitable degree of
   moisture, and then stratification. This approach cannot be used for seed
   to be germinated on agar medium because of the enhanced risk of
   contamination. Several different pre-treatments (warm water or cold
   storage) and application of gibberellic acid (GA(3)) were trialled.
   Germination rates varied widely with species, genotype, and
   pretreatment. The protocol has enabled in vitro kiwifruit seedlings to
   be used to develop bioassays to identify Psa-tolerant offspring in our
   kiwifruit breeding programme. Following the procedures we have
   previously described for in vitro chromosome doubling by treatment with
   colchicine, we are using the in vitro seedlings to create a polyploid
   population for the next generation of novel kiwifruit cultivar
   selection.

AB In order to explore the method of improving the germination rate of
   Gynostemma pentaphyllum seeds, we investigated the effects of different
   factors, namely, illumination and temperature, hormone, storage, low
   temperature stratification and short-term low temperature. The results
   showed that the optimal germination temperature ranged from 15 degrees C
   to 25 degrees C ; illumination raised the germination rate, with the
   highest germination rate(31.54 +/- 2.04)% at the optimum temperature of
   20 degrees C. It was found that Cytokinins, such as 6-BA and zeatin,had
   no effect on the promotion of the germination, and Gibberellin, like
   GA(3), had almost no impact,but GA(4) promoted the germination to (54.00
   +/- 2.65)%. At 18 degrees C, Gynostemma pentaphyllum seeds were stored
   for 30, 90, and 180 days. The results showed that appropriate storage
   time was conducive to break the dormancy mechanism of Gynostemma
   pentaphyllum seed, but when the storage time was too long, the
   germination rate declined rapidly, or even to zero. The statistics of
   low temperature stratification processing showed that the effect of low
   temperature stratification was not obvious. Under low temperature
   stratification for 90 days, the highest germination rate was only (34.26
   +/- 3.21)%. By short-term low temperature treatment, it was found that
   short-term low temperature (9 days of moist storage at 5,10,15 degrees C
   increased the germination rate to (73.06 +/- 2.12)%, (83.14 +/- 3.25)%
   and (72.13 +/- 3.52)%. Comparison of storage treatment and post-storage
   short-term low temperature treatment showed that, with the increase in
   storage time, the germination rate decreased rapidly,while short-term
   low temperature treatment still promoted the germination of long-stored
   seeds.

AB Tilia miqueliana produces woody seeds that exhibit deep dormancy. In
   this study, we used cell biology methods, including Paraffin section
   determination and Coomassie brilliant blue staining, as well as
   proteomics-based methods, including two-dimensional electrophoresis with
   matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation tandem time-of-flight mass
   spectrometry (2DE-MALDI-TOF/TOF), to examine the effects of H2SO4-GA(3)
   and cold stratification (3 degrees C) treatment on proteins during
   dormancy release and germination in T. miqueliana seeds. The results
   revealed that during cold stratification, the area and density of
   proteins in the endosperm cells of H2SO4-GA(3)-treated seeds were
   significantly altered. Total protein content was continuously consumed
   and utilised. Storage proteins (albumin, globulin, prolamin, and
   glutelin) were degraded to varying degrees. Sixteen differential
   proteins were identified using mass spectrometry. Kyoto encyclopedia of
   genes (KEGG) pathway analysis revealed that the
   glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, secondary metabolite biosynthesis,
   glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, and
   metabolic pathways were critical during dormancy release and
   germination. Gene ontology analysis and KEGG pathway annotation of
   differential proteins in the co-expression network indicated that the
   differential proteins are implicated in photosynthesis, glucose
   metabolism, biosynthesis of plant hormones, and
   glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. Synergistic interactions among these
   proteins accelerated dormancy release and germination. Therefore,
   H2SO4-GA(3) cold stratification treatment is the best method for
   achieving rapid dormancy release and increasing the germination rate of
   T. miqueliana seeds.

AB OBJECTIVE: Current study was conducted to investigate the seed
   physiological characteristics of Tulipa edulis and improve germination
   rate.
   METHOD: Anatomical characteristics was observed. Seed water absorption
   curve was tested by soaking method. Dynamic of embryo development and
   germination rate as well as germination index under different conditions
   were recorded. And the biological test of cabbage seed was used for
   detecting the germination inhibitors.
   RESULT: The embryo rate of newly matured seeds was about 10%, and there
   was no obstacle of water absorption on testa of T. edulis. The optimum
   method for embryo development was exposure to 300 mg x L(-1) gibberellin
   solution for 24 hours, and stratification at 25 degrees C for 70 days
   followed by stratification at 5 degrees C for 40 days. The germintion
   rate and germination index of dormancy-broken seeds under the dark
   environment at 10 degrees C and 15 degrees C were significantly higher
   than those under other conditions. Additionally, there were some
   germination inhibitory substances in dry seeds.
   CONCLUSION: The seed of T. edulis can be classified as having complex
   morphophysiological dormancy, and the morphological embryo dormancy
   played a leading role. Warm and cold stratification resulted in a fast
   dormancy breaking effect, and a high germination rate more than 90%
   could be obtained under the optimum conditions.

AB Seed germination of Cleome serrulata Pursh (Capparaceae), often called
   Navajo spinach, stinkweed, or Rocky Mountain beeplant, is often quite
   low, and ways to increase germination percentage have not been
   determined. Cleome serrulata produces large amounts of pollen for many
   insect pollinators, contributes to erosion control, and is occasionally
   used as forage. The distribution of C. serrulata across the US and
   Canada suggests chilling and scarification could positively impact seed
   germination. This study applied various combinations of chilling
   duration (4 or 8 wk) over a range of temperatures (4°C [39°F], (7°C
   [45°F), 10°C [50°F], or 20°C [68°F; control]), scarification with H2O2,
   and various hormones (GA3 or GA4/7 and BA) to C. serrulata seed grown in
   Logan, Utah (seed source origin was Chinle, Arizona). Initial viability
   for C. serrulata seed was 94% via tetrazolium testing. Seed germination
   was responsive to both temperature and hormone applications. As chilling
   temperature increased from 4° to 20°C (39-68°F), germination percentage
   decreased from 50% to less than 2%. Various hormone treatments
   consisting of GA4/7 and BA applied prior to chilling resulted in seed
   germination of greater than 80% whereas less than 10% of untreated seeds
   germinated. Additionally, the speed of germination (T50) increased with
   temperature while germination spread (T10-90) decreased in hormone
   treatments. Our findings show that chilling duration, gibberellins, and
   seed after-ripening all influence seed germination and should be used to
   improve plant establishment.

   temperature fluctuation at different outdoor burial depths (0, 5, and 10
   cm) on seed germination were examined in 14 wetland species from the
   temperate region of central China, with the aim of improving germination
   for rehabilitation. Prior to cold-wet stratification, only seeds of 1
   species, Eclipta prostrata, germinated to a high percentage (>90%), and
   a few seeds (<20%) germinated in 10 species. Five wk of stratification
   significantly promoted germination in 6 species, but only 2 species
   germinated >= 50%. Ten wk of stratification significantly promoted
   germination in 11 species, and 6 species germinated >= 50%. In general,
   seeds of perennials required longer stratification periods than those of
   annuals to come out of dormancy. Burial significantly enhanced
   germination percentages in 7 species. Time to 50% of germination (t(50))
   values indicated that 11 species germinated much faster after burial
   treatments than after stratification treatments. During 1 wk of
   continuous monitoring, the mean amplitude of daily temperature
   fluctuations at 0 cm was much higher than that at the other 2 depths.
   Even though 8 species differed significantly in germination percentages
   at different burial depths, their optimal germination varied in relation
   to burial depth. The results suggest that cold-wet stratification for 10
   wk or outdoor burial for 5 wk could significantly improve seed
   germinability of most temperate wetland plants.

AB OBJECTIVE: Seed dormancy mechanisms, breaking dormancy and the optimal
   germinating conditions were studied to improve reproductive efficiency
   and quality standard of Pseudostellaria heterophylla.
   METHOD: The P. heterophylla seeds were stratified into wettish sand for
   65 days under the temperature of -2-3 degrees C, embryo length and
   germination dynamic change of seeds were measured in prophase every
   other 10 days and in middle every other 5 days. The influences on seed
   germination and seedling growth under different temperatures,
   germination beds were investigated.
   RESULT: The P. heterophylla seeds embryo morphology was unchanged in
   stratification. The seeds could not germinate at stratification within
   the first 35 days. The germination rate and germination energy of seeds
   increased with the stratification time after 35 days. Germination rate,
   germination energy, plant height and fresh weight under the 10 degrees C
   were significantly higher than those under other temperatures.
   Germination rate, germination energy, plant height, fresh weight and dry
   weight of plant in sand bed were higher than those of plant in other
   beds, and seed mildew rate and abnormal seedling proportion of plant in
   sand bed were less than those of plant in other beds.
   CONCLUSION: The dormancy of P. heterophylla seeds is mainly the
   physiological post-maturation. The optimal germination conditions of
   seeds is 10 degrees C the culture of sand. The dormancy was broke under
   -2-3 degrees C of wettish sand for 45-50 days in practice.

AB By investigating and experimenting pollination pattern, reproduction
   mode, fruit and seed dispersal, seed dormancy and germination,
   characters of reproduction ecology of Iris ensata were researched in one
   nature population of Tianmu Mountain, Zhejiang Province from 2006 to
   2008. Results were as follows. (1) The natural population of I. ensata
   was in the spatial pattern of aggregation distribution. Its population
   regeneration was almost built upon asexual reproduction with 0.756
   percent contribution. (2) Artificial pollination indicated that the
   fruit set and seed set of self pollination were much lower than cross
   pollination (P<0.05). The flower of I. ensata being covered by a mesh
   had no seed setting, and the fruit set rate of self-pollination between
   the same or different petal of the flower were 10% and 20% with 0 and 4
   +/- 1 (n=2) seed per fruit respectively. However, the fruit set rate of
   geitonogamy and xenogamy were 80% and 100% respectively, and seeds per
   fruit were 59 +/- 7 (n=8) and 64 +/- 9 (n=10) respectively. The
   pollen-ovule ratio was 1277 +/- 270 (n=10) which further indicated that
   the pollination type of I. ensata was mainly xenogamy. (3) Apis
   mellifica was the effective pollinator with the frequency of 0.019 each
   flower in one minute, and the ratio of visiting the same flower was
   about 3.5%. (4) The seed number was estimated about 368 per square meter
   in nature. Fruits and seeds of I. ensata were persistent and the seed
   had no deep physiological dormancy. Light was needed during seed
   germination and the seed germination rate was 94.9 +/- 0.7% after 60
   days cold moist stratification. (5) We concluded that I. ensata can
   adapt to the wet and cold mountain climates very well, and Tianmu
   Mountain may be one of origin and refuge places of this plant during the
   glacial epoch. The species of I. ensata takes the adaptation strategy of
   k type, and they possess the mechanisms of natural sustaining renovation
   in natural population. Some of those mechanisms are being disturbed more
   or less by human activities now.

   reveal the seed of dormancy mechanism and to research the effective
   dormancy breaking method of Styrax tonkinensis seeds with shells,which
   was 5 years form guanshan forest farm in Ji'an Jiangxi. The results
   indicated that; (1) The reason of seed dormancy includes episperm

   existing in both embryo and episperm; and episperm barrier and the
   existence of germination inhibitors are the primary limit factors. (2)
   The embryo dormancy of S. tonkinensis can be relieved after GA(3)
   treatment and stratification at natural low temperature for 30 days, but
   episperm barrier is always the key constraint factor for its dormancy.
   (3) The chemicals such as GA(3), NAA and 6-BA etc. treatments were used
   to improve the germination rate of S. tonkinensis seeds;one of the
   effective ways is by 500 mg/L GA(3) treatments 24 h for the carved

   analysis were used to divide 10 hot pepper materials into 4 kinds
   according to their tolerance degrees to high temperature and humidity.
   The mathematical evaluation model for hot pepper high temperature and

   humidity tolerance at germination stage were screened. They were
   electrolyte leakage rate, dry weight of seedling, mean germination days,
   germination value and average daily germination rate. These 5 indexes
   could be used under the same stress condition for rapid identification

AB Grafting using a pumpkin (Cucurbita sp.) rootstock is an effective way
   to improve cucumber (Cucumis sativus) resistance to a combination of
   chilling and salinity stresses. We evaluated the tolerance of 15 pumpkin
   cultivars to chilling, salinity, and combined stresses at the
   germination and seedling stages. Selected plant characteristics,
   including germination rate, germination potential, germination index,
   plant height, stem thickness, fresh weight, and dry weight, were
   analyzed. We used the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean
   for cluster analyses to determine the stress tolerance levels of the
   pumpkin cultivars. The 15 cultivars were divided into three clusters:
   tolerant, moderately tolerant, and susceptible to stress treatments. The
   stress tolerances of all cultivars were variable in the germination and
   seedling stages, and most cultivars were not tolerant to individual
   treatments of chilling or salinity stresses at both stages. These
   results suggest that identifying suitable cultivars for use as rootstock
   during cucumber grafting should involve the evaluation of stress
   tolerance during different growth stages. Additionally, cultivars
   tolerant to chilling stress may not be tolerant to salinity stress;
   therefore, the choice of pumpkin rootstock should depend on where the
   grafted plant will be grown. Cultivars tolerant to a combination of
   chilling and salinity stresses may be useful as rootstock for cucumber
   grafting. Our findings may serve as reference material for choosing
   appropriate pumpkin rootstocks for cucumber grafting.

AB The establishment of efficient seed treatments for early germination and
   seedling growth is required to shorten the time that seedlings are in
   the nursery and to shorten breeding cycles. In our previous studies, the
   following has been revealed: (1) a 7-day period of rinsing in water
   combined with chilling at 5°C for four weeks promoted the germination
   rate in seeds of 'Yaguchi' peach more than where two days of rinsing
   were combined with four weeks of chilling; (2) the abscisic acid
   (ABA)-related genes (NCED1, ABA 8-hydroxylase, and PP2C) and stress
   response genes (EID1, DREB2CA, and LEA D-34) were involved in seed
   germination; and (3) the treatment of fluridone, an inhibitor of ABA
   biosynthesis, could promote germination of seeds chilled at 5°C for two
   weeks, however, the seedlings showed dwarfism and had lesions on the
   leaves. In the study reported here, seeds were treated with procaine
   hydrochloride, an inhibitor of DNA methylation, and later with fluridone
   to investigate the involvement of DNA methylation in seed germination
   under conditions with insufficient chilling. The procaine treatments
   that were used did not alleviate dwarfism or lesion development but
   significantly increased the SPAD value of the leaves on the seedlings.
   Preventing leaf yellowing by procaine is beneficial in the case of
   forced germination using fluridone, although the mechanisms of
   interaction between procaine and fluridone are unknown. Further study
   will be necessary to identify the involvement of epigenetics in both the
   dwarfing process and in lesion development in the seedlings grown from
   the seeds that are exposed to insufficient chilling.

AB Daphne giraldii Nitsche (Thymelaeaceae) is a perennial evergreen shrub
   that is widely used in the ornamental plant and pharmaceutical
   industries in China. It exhibits dormancy, which delays and reduces
   germination. This study determined the, effects of chemical treatment,
   stratification and burial treatment for overcoming the seed dormancy of
   D. giraldii. Results showed that chemical pre-treatment was less
   effective in breaking dormancy. The best germination percentage (G(P))
   was 52.33 %, a germination rate (G(R)) of 1.19 only observed after 70 d
   of seed stratification at 5 degrees C treatment, indicating that the
   germination behavior of D. giraldii was not significantly affected by
   stratification. The physiological dormancy of D. giraldii seeds was
   alleviated during burial. Seeds buried at 100 cm depth for 170 days
   showed the highest germination success with G(P) of 86.5 % and G(R) of
   10.11, which was the most effective treatment to alleviate seed
   dormancy. This information may be useful to restore and conserve other
   shrubs grown in Northwestern China and elucidate their survival under
   similar extreme environments.

   rate was 55.56% and germination energy 42.22%; in 100.0 mg/L NAA
   treatment, seed germination rate reached 48.89% and germination energy
   30.00%. In terms of R. chinensis planted in river sand, the germination
   rate was 42.22% and germination energy 24.44%, which were better than
   those in peat-perlite matrix (volume ratio 2:1) and garden soil. Adding
   GA3 in MS media was beneficial for seed germination. When the
   concentration of GA3 was 0.5 mg/L, seed germination rate reached 55.56%
   and germination energy 34.44%. Conclusion: Cold stratification, 100.0
   mg/L GA3 and 100.0 mg/L NAA soaking treatments can raise seed
   germination rate of R. chinensis. Appropriate seeding matrix and culture
   medium can promote seed germination of R. chinensis.

AB Galax (Galax urceolata) leaves are a popular choice for flower
   arrangement. It also is a slow growing species and current levels of
   harvesting are threatening the existence of the wild population. To
   address this trend, a means for successfully expediting the propagation
   of Galax would increase its availability and allow for protection
   against overharvesting and possible extinction. The goal of this study
   was to develop a protocol for in vitro Galax germination and
   proliferation. Influences of light intensity, culture medium pH,
   temperature stratification, and seed maturity were studied for their
   effects on seed germination in vitro. Plant growth regulators (PGR) such
   as 6-benzylaminopurine (BA), indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), and
   gibberellic acid (GA(3)) were tested for their effects on germination.
   In addition, BA and IBA were also tested for shoot development. Our data
   indicated that wild Galax seeds demonstrated 16.7% viability based on
   the test of tetrazolium staining. Light significantly increased the
   germination rate. A stratification temperature of 5 degrees C along with
   increased seed maturity (as determined by seed color) also significantly
   increased seed germination. The highest germination rate (76%) was
   observed from dark-colored seeds stored in the refrigerator at 4 degrees
   C. The PGR treatments of BA and IBA at various ratios inhibited seed
   germination. GA3 exhibited a positive effect on seed germination after
   the cold stratification pretreatment for dark colored seeds. The BA and
   IBA treatments were not effective for initiating shoots after 20 days of
   exposure. While an optimal germination protocol has been established,
   more research is needed to develop a protocol for seedling proliferation
   and shoot initiation leading to an efficient production system of Galax
   plants.

AB Chill stress has severe impacts on the growth, development and

   (YW9816 and YW9706) were obtained by screening a total of 296 maize
   inbred lines under chilling stress at the seedling stage in artificial
   incubator. The chill resistant inbred lines showed high relative
   germination rate and low level of wilting, while proline content,
   relative conductivity, chlorophyll content and soluble sugar content
   increased. According to cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism
   (cDNA-AFLP) analysis, the 441 transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) were
   differentially expressed. Three full-length cDNA were isolated through
   in silico cloning and named ZmMAPKKK, ZmCLC-D and ZmRLK. According to
   real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, the expression of
   novel genes appeared to be strongly induced by chill stress.

   optimum at 28.degree. C. At 28.degree. C, promycelia protruded from the
   teliospores after 12 h on a 2.5% plain agar disc. After 24 h the
   germination rate reached 34.9%. The promycelium attained a length of
   50-60 .mu.m and a width of 2.5-10 .mu.m with 4-6 septa. A few promycelia
   could protrude from single teliospores. Sporidia produced on promycelia
   propagated by budding and measured 30-40 .mu.m in length with 2-3 cells
   at maturity. Chilling treatment at 4 and 8.degree. C highly promoted
   germination. At a concentration level of 0.05 M, C sources which
   promoted germination were in the ascending order of lactose, galactose,
   glycerol, fructose, starch, glucose, maltose and sucrose. N sources, in
   the concentration level of 0.005 M, also promoting germination were in
   the ascending order of sodium nitrate, ammonium nitrate, ammonium
   chloride, ammonium sulfate, potassium nitrate and asparagine. Glycine
   had no effect, while glutamic acid reduced germination. The effect of
   some media on teliospore germination was examined; potato-sucrose medium
   was the best medium for germination in U. escultenta at 26.degree. C for
   24 h. Heat tolerance of teliospore germination was also tested.

   Sun ( typical caryopsis), D. membranaceus Munro ( nut-like caryopsis),
   Schizostachyum sp. ( typical caryopsis), Qiongzhuea tumidinoda Hsueh et
   Yi ( berry-like caryopsis), and Chimonocalamus pallens Hsueh et Yi (
   typical caryopsis). No dormancy was observed during the process of
   germination of these seeds. The fresh and ripe seeds begin to germinate
   in 5 similar to 15 days after sowing, and finish within 15 days. The
   results of test showed that the field germination rates were: 84. 0% (D.
   asper), 81. 0% (D. membranaceus), 43. 3% (D. sinicus), 73. 5% (S. sp.)
   and 25. 0% ( Q. tumidinoda). The medium, MS + BA 0. 5 + NAA 0. 2, was
   the best for the bamboo seed germination. The germination rate of seed
   stratified at 20 degrees C similar to 25 degrees C was significantly
   higher than that at 4 degrees C. Sowed after 10 days' soaking in water,
   the seed germination rates of D. asper, D. membranaceus, S. sp. and Q.
   tumidinoda dropped to 0 similar to 5. 5%. When stored at 4 degrees C or
   at 20 degrees C similar to 25 degrees C with humidity of 10% - 15%, the
   seed germination rates of these six bamboos decreased gradually and
   dropped to 0 similar to 4. 0% after 90 days. It could increase seed
   lifespan of Ch. pallens when stored in soil at 4 degrees C.

AB The objective of this study was to understand the germination
   characteristics of Litsea coreana seeds and to determine the seed
   storage behavior to suggest the most appropriate treatment for seed
   storage. Fresh samples from seedlot 1 reached a germination percentage
   of 6.3%, while no germination was observed in seedlot 2 after incubation
   under alternating temperatures of 30/20 degrees C (day/night) for 12 wk.
   However, 6 and 7 mo of 4 degrees C stratification broke the seed
   dormancy, leading to 63.4 and 81.9% germination rates for seedlots 1 and
   2, respectively. Emergence was able to occur within 4 wk with mean
   germination times of 15.0 and 18.2 d, respectively. Moreover, a combined
   2-mo warm (30/20 degrees C) and 2-mo cold (4 degrees C) stratification
   was another effective pretreatment for dormancy breaking, with the
   germination percentages of these 2 seedlots reaching 82.5 and 78.6%,
   while the germination period was decreased to 3 wk and the mean
   germination times were 13.8 and 21.9 d, respectively. According to our
   results, most seeds of L. coreana can survive desiccation to 6 similar
   to 14% moisture contents, whereas they were extremely sensitive to -20
   degrees C as evidenced by the fact that the viability of the seeds at 2
   similar to 25% moisture contents were totally lost within 4 h. At a
   Moisture content or about 6%, L. coreana seeds were most capable of
   remaining viable when stored at 1, 4, and 15 degrees C; in comparison,
   the viability of those at moisture contents of < 3% or > 10%
   substantially declined at the same temperatures. Furthermore, seed
   viability was best maintained at a temperature of 4 degrees C rather
   than 1 or 15 degrees C. Therefore, L. coreana seeds were considered to
   express an intermediate storage behavior due to their moderate tolerance
   of desiccation and sensitivity to freezing temperatures. Additionally,
   the optimal approach for L. coreana seeds is moist storage at 4 degrees
   C, which enabled 65% of initially germinable seeds to remain viable
   after 2 yr.

   percentage of freshly collected mature seeds of S. discolor from Duona,

   temperatures of 30/20 degrees C with 8 h of light. With cold
   stratification of freshly collected seeds for 2 mo, the germination
   percentage reached as high as 85.3%. Therefore, about 30% of seeds
   showed deep dormancy. The mean germination time was reduced from 54 d
   for freshly collected mature seeds to 41 d after I mo of stratification.
   Seed germinability of S. discolor could be maintained at -20 similar to

   1.8 and 7.9% (on a fresh-weight basis). These results confirm that S.

   survived when they were desiccated to 5.3-12.5% MCs; however, the
   viability of those seeds with 3.7 similar to 12.5% MCs dropped
   significantly at -20 degrees C after 24 mo of hermetic storage. The
   optimum seed moisture contents of B. javanica were 8, 5 similar to 13,
   and 5 similar to 8% for -20, 4, and 15 degrees C storage, respectively.
   The temperature effect on seed longevity revealed that the longevity of
   seeds stored at 4 degrees C was better than those at -20 and 15 degrees
   C. We estimated that the optimum seed storage conditions for B. javanica
   are provided by combining a temperature of 4 degrees C with about an 8%

   of these 2 species could completely germinate under alternating

   germination times of their freshly mature seeds were 15.6 and 11.8 d,

   effect on the rate of germination. The seeds of C. dichotoma
   deteriorated rapidly when the chilling period was extended to 9 mo and

   period extended to longer than 4 mo, seeds of C. sinensis forced seed
   germination under chilling conditions, and complete seed germination
   could be achieved when the chilling period was extended to 7 mo. Thus, 4

   characterized by very low deterioration rates if the moisture content
   was maintained at between 5 and 15% at either 4 or 15degreeC in 2 yr of
   storage. Chilling treatment at 4degreeC had little beneficial effect on

   times significantly increased. The mean germination times of seeds
   significantly increased in a period of 3 and 24 mo of dry storage at

AB The effects of moisture content and temperature on the storage behavior
   of seeds of Gordonia axillaris (Boxb.) Dietr., Pistacia chinensis Bunge,
   and Koelreuteria henryi Dummer were investigated. The germination
   percentages of these 3 species did not decline after 18-24 mo of storage
   at -20degreeC, 5% moisture content, therefore, confirming their orthodox
   seed storage behavior. The optimum seed moisture contents for the
   storage of seeds of these 3 species at -20degreeC were 5-10%, 4-9%, and
   5-10% (fresh weight), respectively. Only seeds of P. chinensis showed
   slight dormancy; non-dormant viable seeds of these 3 species would
   germinate completely within 8 wk in germination tests. After prechilling
   at 4degreeC for 2 mo, the germination percentage of fresh mature seeds
   of P. chinensis increased but not in the other 2 species. The mean
   germination times of seeds of G. axillaris and P. chinensis were reduced
   by 50% by prechilling 8 and 2 mo at 4 degreeC, respectively. The effect
   of prechilling treatment on the mean germination time of seeds of K.
   henryi was not apparent. In this article, the practice of fruit
   collection, seed treatment, seed storage, and stratification for each

AB The purpose of this study was to examine the germination characteristics
   of seeds of Scaevola taccada. Effects of the seed moisture content (MC)
   and storage temperature on germination were investigated to determine
   its seed storage behavior. Results showed that seeds of S. taccada were
   non-dormant. The majority of fresh mature seeds germinated during 2-5 wk
   under fluctuating temperatures of 30/20°C with 8 h of light, and few
   seeds irregularly germinated in the subsequent 5-20 wk. It was
   speculated that the difference in germination speed was related to the
   degree of seed maturity. Moreover, stratification at 4°C neither
   improved germination nor decreased the mean germination times (MGTs) of
   seeds of S. taccada. In other words, stratification at 4°C is not
   practical for nursery operations because it cannot promote more-uniform
   germination. Besides, the seeds faced a great risk of dying during moist
   storage at 4°C for more than 3 mo; thus, moist storage at 4°C should not
   be applied to short-term storage of seeds of S. taccada. However, seeds
   of S. taccada dried to 1.9-5.9% MCs (on a fresh-weight basis) still
   maintained viability after 2 yr of storage at -20, 4, and 15°C. Seeds of
   S. taccada can tolerate desiccation and sub-zero temperatures, which
   qualifies them as orthodox. In short, seeds of S. taccada can be stored
   over a long-term period to assure future seed supplies. If seed storage
   of S. taccada is used for plant germplasm collection and long-term
   conservation, we recommend that seeds of S. taccada should be dehydrated
   to 3-7% MCs and then hermetically sealed before storage at -20°C.

AB Maackia taiwanensis is an endemic tree species and an endangered species
   of Taiwan. The purpose of this study was to examine the germination
   characteristics and storability of seeds of M. taiwanensis. The effects
   of the seed moisture content (MC) and storage temperature on germination
   were investigated to determine the seed storage behavior and evaluate
   the feasibility of long-term seed storage for ex situ conservation of
   this rare species. Results showed that seeds of M. taiwanensis were
   non-dormant. Fresh mature seeds of 2 seedlots of M. taiwanensis
   completely germinated within 4 wk under fluctuating temperatures of
   30/20°C with 8 h of light. Moreover, stratification at 4°C did not
   efficiently improve the germination percentage but significantly
   decreased the mean germination times (MGTs). Though the MGT of fresh
   mature seeds was significantly reduced from about 15 d to about 8 d
   after only 1-mo stratification at 4°C, pretreatment with stratification
   at 4°C for germination of M. taiwanensis is not practical for nursery
   operations due to this species' quick germination characteristic. In
   addition, seeds began to germinate after stratification at 4°C for 6 mo,
   and almost all viable seeds also germinated under a moist dark condition
   within 6-14 mo. Therefore, moist stratification at 4°C is not workable
   to store seeds of this species. However, seeds of M. taiwanensis dried
   to 2.5-7.8% MCs (on a fresh-weight basis) still maintained viability
   after 2 yr of storage at -20, 4, and 15°C. From the results, seeds of M.
   taiwanensis can tolerate desiccation and sub-zero temperatures, which
   qualifies them as orthodox. In short, seeds of M. taiwanensis can be
   stored over a long-term period to ensure future seed supplies. If seed
   storage of M. taiwanensis is used for plant germplasm collection and

AB Pasania glabra is a native tree species of Taiwan and is estimated to be
   a near-threatened plant. The purpose of this study was to examine the
   germination characteristics and seed storage behavior of P. glabra so as
   to determine efficient pretreatment for germination and an appropriate
   seed storage method. Results showed that seeds of P. glabra were
   dormant, and the dormancy could be broken by low-temperature
   stratification. Fresh mature seeds of P. glabra germinated slowly and
   took about 20 wk to completely germinate with a mean germination time
   (MGT) of about 70 d under fluctuating temperatures of 30/20°C with 8 h
   of light. However, stratification at 1 and 4°C was unable to efficiently
   improve germination percentages but significantly decreased the MGTs in
   a germination period of 20 wk, and 1 and 4°C stratification for 2-12 mo
   completely broke the dormancy of P. glabra seeds. The MGT of fresh
   mature seeds significantly decreased from about 70 d to about 30 d after
   4 mo of stratification at 4°C. Therefore, pretreatment with 4°C chilling
   for the germination of P. glabra seeds is practical for nursery
   operations. We suggest that pre-chilling at 4°C for 4 mo should be
   applied to fresh mature seeds of P. glabra. Furthermore, fresh mature
   seeds of P. glabra were extremely sensitive to desiccation. Seeds
   completely lost viability when the moisture content (MC) dropped below
   25%. However, P. glabra seeds maintained their initial viability for up
   to 2 yr when stored at 1-4°C with moist sphagnum. Thus, seeds of P.
   glabra are defined as having temperate-recalcitrant storage behavior due
   to their extreme intolerance of dehydration and high viability with
   low-temperature moist storage. The optimal seed storage conditions of P.
   glabra are moist storage at 1-4°C for fresh mature seeds, and the
   initially germinable seeds still had germinability for up to 2 yr.

   stratification completely broke seed dormancy. Fresh mature seeds of C.
   brevistyla were sensitive to desiccation and low temperatures. Most
   seeds died when the moisture content dropped to about 10%; moreover,
   they completely lost viability when the moisture content dropped below
   5%, and seed germinability rapidly decreased at a storage temperature of
   -20°C. However, C. brevistyla seeds maintained their initial

   about 8 d. In fact, such a reduction in the MGT is not practical in the

   seeds which could be dried to 2.0-7.6% MCs (on a fresh-weight basis)
   still maintained viability after storage at 4 and -20°C for 24 mo. This

AB Primula beesiana Forr. is an attractive wildflower endemically
   distributed in the wet habitats of subalpine/alpine regions of
   southwestern China. This study is an attempt to understand how this
   plant adapts to wet habitats and high altitudes. Specifically, we
   examined the effects of cold stratification, light, GA(3), KNO3, and
   temperature on P. beesiana seed germination. KNO3 and GA(3) increased
   germination percentage and germination rate compared to control
   treatments at 15/5 and 25/15 degrees C. Untreated seeds germinated well
   (> 80%) at higher temperatures (20, 25 and 28 degrees C), whereas at
   lower (5, 10 and 15 degrees C) and extremely high temperatures (30 and
   32 degrees C) germination decreased significantly. However, after cold
   stratification (4-16 weeks), the germination percentage of P. beesiana
   seeds at low temperatures (5-15 degrees C) and the germination rate at
   high temperatures (30 degrees C) increased significantly, suggesting
   that P. beesiana has type 3 non-deep physiological dormancy. The base
   temperature and thermal time for germination decreased in seeds that
   were cold stratified for 16 weeks. Cold-stratified seeds incubated at
   fluctuating temperatures (especially at 15/5 degrees C) had
   significantly high germination percentages and germination rates in
   light, but not in dark, compared to the corresponding constant
   temperature (10 degrees C). Seeds had a strict light requirement at all
   temperatures, even after experiencing cold stratification; however, the
   combinations of cold stratification and fluctuating temperature
   increased germination when seeds were transferred from dark to light.
   Such dormancy/germination responses to light and temperature are likely
   mechanisms that ensure germination occurs only in spring and at/near the
   soil surface, thus avoiding seedling death by freezing, inundation
   and/or germination deep in the soil. Copyright (C) 2020 Kunming

   four replications and three treatments, including three different
   concentrated sulfuric acid treatments (10, 30 and 60 min), varying
   concentrations of GA3 (0, 100 and 300 mg/L) and 4 levels of
   stratification (0; 0-5°C, 30 d; 15-20<C, 30 d and 15-20°C, 10 d->0-5°C,
   20 d). The germination percentage and mean germination time of treated
   seeds were significantly enhanced by mentioned treatments compared with
   control. It was concluded that altering temperature stratification was
   more effective on studied dormancy breaking traits than others.
   Moreover, cold stratification was a better treatment on breaking seed
   dormancy of T. amurensis seeds than concentrated H2SO4 and GA3
   treatments. Applying concentrated sulfuric acid for 30 min and 100 mg/L
   concentration of GA3 and stratification (15-20°C, 10 d->0-5°C, 20 d)
   results in higher germination in T. amurensis dormant seeds, and

   range of this endangered species. We then describe an in situ reserve
   that has been established. We also investigated some reproductive
   characteristics of M. sieversii including pollen germination, seed
   dormancy, and seed viability. Both stratification and seedcoat removal
   efficiently released seed dormancy and accelerated seed germination.
   Pollen germination rate is around 60%. Our data suggest that injurious
   insects and human activities, rather than reproductive characters, limit
   the renewal of M. sieversii.

   (Xinluzao 10 and Xinluzao 13) at different temperature sensitivities.
   Under low temperature stress, nitric oxide treatment increased the

   (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and the content of soluble protein
   and proline (Pro), and decreased the relative conductivity and
   malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the cotton seed embryo. The nitric
   oxide treatment also significantly increased the average germination
   rate and shortened the germination time. After 48 h of seed inhibition
   at low temperatures, the germination rate increased by 29.85% and the
   germination time decreased by 3 d in the SNP treatment, compared with

   seedlings. Grafted blueberry plants were compared to their own rooted
   plants under two soil treatments. Results demonstrated that fruit
   firmness, size, total soluble solids, and titratable acidity were not
   affected by grafting and soil treatments. Variations in foliar nutrient
   levels N, P, K, Ca, Mg and Mn observed in the grafted plants may be due

   influence of environmental factors such as different light and
   temperature during germination and seed soaking treatment with GA3 at
   different concentrations were discussed. Result: (1) Fruiting
   characteristics of R. changii population growing in shrub and mossy
   dwarf forest were better than those in broadleaf forest (P < 0.05), and
   the percent of seed bearing mother trees ranged from 39.58% to 66.67% in
   four populations. The stratification effect of seed setting in canopy
   was obvious, and the fruit setting rate was between 43.90% and 58.62%,
   and the low seed plumpness rate varied from 9.89% to 15.71%.
   Morphological phenotype of seeds from the same maternal plant showed
   continuous variation, and the seeds with different morphological
   phenotypes possessed great breeding potential. (2)Fruiting was mainly
   affected by the limitation of light resources. The light condition of
   maternal plants was positively correlated with fruit setting rate,
   full-developed seeds rate and seed width (P < 0.01). The less light was,
   the lower percentage the full-developed seeds was and the more the
   oblong seeds (seed width/seed length < 0.4) were. (3)The seed
   germination characteristics were mainly affected by the morphological
   phenotype of seeds, followed by light condition and age of the maternal
   plant and the degree of fruit cracking. That is, the greater the ratio
   of seed width to seed length and the more sufficient lighting of the
   maternal plant, the higher the seed germination rate and vigor index of
   seedlings. The older the maternal plants and the more complete the fruit
   cracking, the lower the seed germination rate and vigor index of
   seedlings. In addition, the germination ability of oval seeds (seed
   width/seed length ≥0.4) was better than that of long-round seeds. (4)The
   seed of R. changii had light-requiring physiological dormancy. The
   germination rate under dark conditions was significantly lower than that
   under light conditions. The seed germination rate and seedling vigor
   index were positively correlated with light. The germination rate and
   seedling vigor index were significatly increased through seed soaking
   treatment with GA3 in the suitable concentration range of 400-600
   mg.L-1. The seeds had a wide range of adaptability to temperature with
   germination just at 5°C, but the proportion of deformed seedlings was
   larger under low temperature conditions, and the optimum temperature for
   germination was 20-25°C. Conclusion: The intense light competition in
   the natural community leads to continuous decline of suitability of the
   habitat, and gradually tends to small populations. Limitation of light
   resources affects fruiting characteristics, causing the decline of seed
   yield and quality, and hence decline of the sexual reproductive ability
   gradually. Under the adverse natural conditions such as weak light under
   the forest, the transformation from seed to seedling is inhibited. Seeds
   germination starts at low temperature but with low germination
   efficiency, which increases the risk of population. Thus, forest trees
   should be thinned and surface litter should be cleared to improve the
   light condition of population and soil seed bank. In order to maintain
   the population development, artificial propagation should be
   implemented. The seedlings could be cultivated with yellowish-green
   fruit with slightly cracked capsules at the early stage of fruit
   ripening and oval seeds.

   conditions. Cold stratification was used with different pretreatments of
   GA(3), and/or magnetically-treated water to try to break the dormancy
   and obtain higher and more uniform germination. Exogenous application of
   GA(3) with or without magnetically-treated water enhanced seed
   germination significantly (P < 0.001) compared with the control.
   Combination treatments proved to be more effective than GA(3) alone,
   reducing the duration of cold stratification required for high
   germination. The combination treatment of GA(3) and 500mT
   magnetically-treated water resulted in 75% germination after 75 days
   cold stratification with a germination rate of 36.54% day(-1).

AB Ferula jaeschkeana Vatke, an important medicinal plant of the Himalayan
   region, being threatened needs immediate conservation strategies.
   Keeping this in view studies on the germination of seeds and sprouting
   of vegetative propagules has been undertaken for the first time. At the
   time of dispersal, F. jaeschkeana seeds are dormant and have
   under-developed embryos. The aims of the present work were to determine
   the requirements for germination and overcoming dormancy and to
   characterize the type of seed dormancy. The seeds of F. jaeschkeana have
   deep complex morpho-physiological dormancy. Present study revealed that
   final germination percentage, mean daily germination, seed vigour index,
   germination index, germination rate and germination value were highest
   (53.3 %, 0.88, 3.67, 0.13, 0.88 and 1.02, respectively) when 200 ppm
   kinetin and dry stratification (60 days) were applied together. The
   decline in MGT up to 36.18 days and highest percentage survival (87.9
   +/- 7.08) were also observed in the same treatment. This treatment is
   thus recommended for promoting the germination process of F. jaeschkeana
   seeds. Maximum seed germination (62.0 +/- 11.54 %) at 1 in. depth was
   found in seeds presoaked in kinetin (100 ppm) for 24 h in media of
   sand:soil (2:1). In case of root tuber cuttings, 500 ppm gibberellic
   acid showed significantly high sprouting (89.70 +/- 0.78 and 69.14 +/-
   0.82 %, respectively) and rooting percentage (78.78 +/- 1.13 and 55.56
   +/- 0.95 %, respectively) in case of both perennial and biennial plants.
   Likewise minimum time taken for sprouting was also observed in the same
   treatment in case of both perennial (10.0 +/- 1 days) and biennial
   plants (11.33 +/- 2.3 days).

AB The medicinal plant, coastal glehnia (Glehnia littoralis F. Schmidt ex
   Miq.), belongs to the Apiaceae, which is known to exhibit
   morpho-physiological seed dormancy (MPD). In this study, we aimed to
   determine the dormancy type of this plant, along with the conditions for
   breaking dormancy, and how to increase its germination rate for mass
   production. Initially, the seeds of coastal glehnia had undeveloped
   embryos, which gradually developed following cold (5 degrees C)
   stratification over eight weeks. The embryo to seed (E:S) ratio
   increased to 66.7%, confirming that the seeds had the MPD type. Coastal
   glehnia seeds with pericarp did not show inhibited water uptake, and the
   germination inhibitory chemicals were not detected. However, removal of
   the pericarp improved the final germination percentage, germination
   speed, and T-50 of coastal glehnia seeds compared with those of seeds
   with pericarp at 20 degrees C, which showed the highest value compared
   with other temperature treatments. Thus, cold stratification at 5
   degrees C for eight weeks and removing the pericarp of germinating seeds
   maintained at 20 degrees C is efficient ways to break dormancy and
   improve the germination rate for the mass production of coastal glehnia.

   minimum germination temperature was 5°C. The optimum germination
   temperature was 15°C. Soil pH had no significant effect on germination,
   whereas salinity had marked effects on viability and germination. The
   highest germination rate following GA3 [gibberellic acid] application
   was 9% for a concentration of 150 ppm in 2003 and 4.5% for a
   concentration of 100 ppm in 2004. After stratification, the seeds
   germinated in various media. Germination was most pronounced at a soil
   depth of 0-2 cm. The increase in the stratification period increased the
   germination ratio. After stratification, germination was greatest at
   5°C. The results indicated that the seed coat and stratification have

AB Vitex rotundifolia, sandy plant and halophyte, naturally grows on the
   sandy beach coast front with arid and barren soil. In order to adapt to
   the adverse environment of strong wind and sea immersion, the seeds of
   V. rotundifolia have developed a deep dormancy. This study aimed to
   explore the dormancy characteristics of V. rotundifolia seed and the
   methods of breaking the seed dormancy, so as to provide theoretical
   basis to the propagation from seeds and large-scale production. Method:
   In this study, water absorption of the fruit and seed was measured. The
   sites and types of endogenous germination inhibitors were biologically
   identified, the mechanical barrier of the seed coat was broken with
   physical means concentrated H2SO4, cutting peel, and the inhibitor
   concentration was reduced by low temperature stratification and GA3
   treatment to study the possible types of and cause for dormancy, and
   methods of breaking dormancy of V. rotundifolia. Result: The results
   showed that:1 Vitex rotundifolia had a thick pericarp, and the endocarp
   had a completely corked stone cell layer with a seed empty shell rate of
   26%. The peel had obvious mechanical hindrance to the water absorption,
   and the seed had no water absorption barrier. 2 The water extract and
   methanol extract of the peel were able to significant inhibit the seed
   germination and seedling growth of Chinese cabbage. The inhibitory
   effect of water extract on the seed germination and seedling growth of
   Chinese cabbage was more obvious than that of methanol extract under the
   same concentration, that is, the activity of the water-soluble
   germination inhibitor is greater than that of the alcohol-soluble
   germination inhibitor. The GA3 treatment of peel water extract and
   methanol extract could significantly improve the seed germination rate,
   root length and seedling height of Chinese cabbage. The water extract
   and methanol extract of the seeds did not significantly inhibit the seed
   germination and seedling growth of Chinese cabbage, indicating that the
   presence of water-soluble and alcohol-soluble germination inhibitors in
   the pericarp of V. rotundifolia is the main cause of seed dormancy. 3
   Seed dormancy was able to be broken down by low temperature
   stratification for 90 d, GA3, GA3+concentrated H2SO4, GA3+cutting peel,
   GA3+low temperature stratification for 30 d, GA3+low temperature
   stratification for 60 d and GA3+low temperature stratification for 90 d.
   The seed germination time under GA3+concentrated H2SO4 treatment was the
   shortest 14 days, and the germination rate was the highest 44%.
   Conclusion: The mechanical barrier and the endogenous inhibitor of the
   peel are the main factors affecting the dormancy of Vitex rotundifolia.
   Treatment with 500 mg.L-1GA3+concentrated H2SO4 can effectively release
   seed dormancy and increase germination rate.

   treatment, plant hormones treatment, and stratification were conducted
   using the seeds of 6 herbs growing naturally around river banks, such as
   Setaria glauca and faberii, Imperata cylindrica var. koenigii,
   Miscanthus sinensis, Pennisetum alopecuroides, Lespedeza cuneata and the
   seeds of 3 shrubs, such as Lespedeza bicolor., Rosa multiflora, Spiraea
   prunifolia for. simpliciflora. The findings are as follows.In case of
   herbs, Setaria glauca and faberii. have stone seeds. In the treatment
   with H2SO4, they were germinated through dormancy breaking, even though
   there were some differences depending on immersion time, and the
   germination rate of Setaria faberii was a bit higher than that of
   Setaria glauca. The germination rate of Imperata cylindrica var.
   koenigii was low in the treatment with GA3, NAA, and the plant hormone,
   but the seed germination rate has improved and the germination rate of
   Miscanthus sinensis and Pennisetum alopecuroides showed the improved
   seed germination rate in low temperature treatment. In case of Lespedeza
   cuneata and bicolor, the leguminous plants, the treatment with H2SO4 was
   most effective for the improvement of seed germination and the decrease
   in germination time. Only Spiraea prunifolia for. simpliciflora, the
   rose among 3 woody plants showed the seed germination rate above 50%
   without any additional treatment. Thus, it was thought to be appropriate
   for greening. Rosa multiflora showed the attribute of germination in a
   dark condition at low temperature through stratification, despite its
   low germination rate.Based on the results as above, with respect to the
   greening using directly collected seeds, Miscanthus sinensis, Pennisetum
   alopecuroides, and Spiraea prunifolia for. simpliciflora are suitable
   for greening, because they do not need any additional treatment, and
   Lespedeza cuneata and bicolor are also suitable for greening because it
   is possible to improve the germination rate and reduce the germination
   time through the treatment on the seeds before sowing.

AB Silver linden (Tilia tomentosa) seed has the character of complex
   dormancy. Based on the dormant mechanism of silver linden seed and the
   previous results with a single factor experiment on breaking seed
   dormancy, an orthogonal design L27 (313) with four factors (removal of
   pericarp and dipping in water, GA3 treatment, 6 - BA treatment and
   stratification) and three levels was conducted to explore the optimal
   technical combination for quickly breaking seed dormancy, promoting
   germination and seedling vigorous growth. The result indicated: the
   optimal combination of factor and level was: (1) pericarp removal by
   machine; (2) scalding seeds for 2 s with 100°C boiling water, then
   soaking in room temperature water for 24 h; (3) soaking in 200 mg
   litre-1 GA3 and 6 - BA solution, respectively for 24 h; (4)
   stratification in varying temperature, i.e. warm temperature (10-15°C)
   for 5 days, then in low temperature (0-5°C) for 15 days. Seeds treated
   with this combination germinated after 20 days. The germination rate in
   nursery garden was 71.2%, and the seedlings grew vigorously.

AB Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are important
   intracellular signaling events that mediate signal transduction
   associated with plant responses to environmental stresses. In this
   study, tomato plants were subjected to treatments of low (4 A degrees C)
   and high-temperature (42 A degrees C) and exogenous application of
   methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid and hydrogen peroxide. Results show
   that tomato leaves from treated plants contained an elevated level of
   the MAPK gene (SlMPK3). Transient expression assay of onion epidermal
   cells using pBI121-GFP constructs indicate that the SlMPK3 was
   predominantly localized in nuclei. In transgenic tobacco plants
   overexpressing SlMPK3, leaves contained less reactive oxygen species
   (ROS), more superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, ascorbate
   peroxidase activities, higher proline and soluble sugar contents, and an
   elevated transcript level of stress-responsive genes. Seeds derived from
   those SlMPK3 transgenic tobacco plants had a significant higher
   germination rate (P < 0.05) under chilling stress (12 A degrees C). The
   transgenic seedlings also developed larger root system under the same
   temperature treatment conditions. Taken together, these data demonstrate
   that SlMPK3 acts as a positive regulator in the response to low
   temperature stress by regulating ROS homeostasis through activation of
   cellular antioxidant systems and modulating the transcription of
   stress-associated genes.

AB We explored the effects of gibberellic acid (GA3) in releasing seed
   hypocotyl dormancy of Paeonia rockii hybrids, and investigated the
   effects of root length, duration of the chilling treatment ((31)°C) and
   GA3 concentration on the epicotyl dormancy breaking and seedling growth.
   Results showed that 100 mg/L GA3 treatment was the best to promote
   rooting. During the process of seed germination, interaction of root
   length and chilling treatment had a significant effect on the first
   sprouting time and germination rate. GA3 and chilling treatment could
   effectively promote the germination of seeds with radicle roots longer
   than 40 mm; on this basis, the chilling treatment for 14 d, combined
   respectively with 100, 200 mg/L GA3 or 500 mg/L GA3, was in favor of
   seed germination. GA3 and chilling treatment could also promote
   effectively the growth of seedlings with radicle roots longer than 40
   mm, and the chilling treatment for 14 d, combined with 500 mg/L GA3, was
   optimum for seedling growth. We summarized the optimum procedure for
   seed germination as follows. First, the seeds should be soaked in 100
   mg/L GA3 solution for 24 h and stratified in sand until roots grew up to
   40 mm in length. Then they should be sowed in plug trays under the
   chilling treatment for 14 d. Finally, after being watered with 500 mg/L
   GA3 solution, they can grow up into seedlings under the greenhouse
   conditions.

AB In order to clarify conditions needed for the seed dormancy release of
   Anemone rivularis, and provide reference information for grassland
   management and A. rivularis cultivation, the effects on A. rivularis
   seed germination characteristics of dry storage at room temperature and
   stratification in natural conditions in an alpine meadow were studied.
   Storage time, peeling and illumination affected the time required for
   germination, germination percentage and germination index of A.
   rivularis seed. With increased storage time, time required for
   germination of peeled A. rivularis seeds decreased and the germination
   percentage and germination index increased to different degrees. With
   illumination, the number of days required for germination of both peeled
   and unpeeled A. rivularis seeds stored for 40 to 180 days was
   significantly lower (P<0.05) than that of the same seeds without
   storage. There were no significant differences in the germination of
   peeled A. rivularis between seeds stored for 40, 80, 150 or 180 days
   although germination was always significantly higher (P<0.05) than that
   of same seeds without storage. The germination of unpeeled A. rivularis
   seeds stored at room temperature for 180 days was significantly higher
   (P<0.05) than that of same seeds stored for 80 and 150 days, which in
   turn was significantly higher (P<0.05) than that of same seeds stored
   for 40 days. All of the germination percentages of unpeeled A. rivularis
   seeds with storage were significantly higher (P<0.05) than those of same
   seeds without storage. Both illumination and stratification in a natural
   alpine meadow during the cold season reduced the days required for
   germination of A. rivularis seeds and improved germination percentage
   and germination index. The time required for initial germination of A.
   rivularis seeds with stratification and trampling and subject to
   alternating temperatures of 30/20°C or 20/10°C was significantly shorter
   (P<0.05) than that of seeds subjected to stratification without
   trampling under the same germination conditions. The germination of A.
   rivularis seeds with treatments comprising stratification and trampling
   at alternating temperatures of 25/15°C and 20/10°C was 38.0% and 35.3%,
   respectively, which was significantly higher (P<0.05) than that of
   treatments comprising stratification without trampling under the same
   germination conditions (22.7% and 14.0%, respectively). However,
   unpeeled A. rivularis seeds stored dry at room temperature in the same
   period (November to April) did not germinate. Un-germinated A. rivularis
   seeds had a 40.2% germination rate after stratification in Tianzhu
   alpine meadow from October to August in the following year.
   Un-germinated seeds could also germinate under alternating temperature
   regimes ranging from 30/20°C to 20/5°C with the highest observed
   germination percentage being 15.3% at 30/20°C. This indicates that the
   majority of seeds still remained dormant after initial treatment.

   in 2018 and categorized into six groups based on X-ray images.
   Germination tests were performed without and with 2 weeks of moist 5
   degrees C treatment [cold stratification (CS)]. Seeds harvested at 38
   DAF (30 Apr.) with well-developed vegetative organs (embryo and
   endosperm) in seeds categorized as A and B (seed A and seed B,
   respectively) based on the X-ray images were considered fully developed,
   and 80% of seeds were considered mature. However, the germination rates
   were less than 26% or 28% when full seeds harvested at 43 DAF received
   no or 14 days of CS treatment, respectively. Our study suggests that the
   low germination rate of fully developed seeds as judged by X-ray images
   showing well-developed embryo and endosperm could result from the
   presence of dormancy that was not broken effectively by 14 days of CS
   coupled with the loss of viability caused by 8 months of dry storage at

AB Seeds of Pulsatilla turczaninovii were categorized to full and empty
   seeds based on observations under a light microscope and on X-ray
   images. A germination test for full or empty seeds was evaluated as
   affected by the duration of gibberellin GA(3) and the moist 5 degrees C
   cold stratification (CS) treatment. The morphological and elemental
   components of P. turczaninovii and P. cernua var. koreana seeds were
   analyzed using low-temperature scanning electron microscopy (LT-SEM) and
   energy dispersive X-ray diffraction analysis. The results showed that
   64% of full and semifull P. turczaninovii seeds 10 weeks after
   harvesting germinated in 17 to 19 days; however, the germination rate,
   including empty and semiempty seeds, was lower (52.6%). Full seeds with
   damaged or dried vegetative organs (embryo or endosperm) and semifull
   seeds with severely damaged vegetative organs were observed, and this
   result could be related to low germination rates. Germination patterns
   of seeds stored dry at 5 degrees C for 44 weeks that showed a sigmoid
   pattern were increased by immersing seeds in a GA(3) solution for 8
   hours and treating seeds with 16 or 32 days of CS. More seeds germinated
   between 12 and 17 days (as compared with 17 to 29 days), especially when
   they were treated with GA(3) and received 32 days of CS. Comparison of
   germination rates of visually full seeds upon harvest (52.6%) with those
   that had been stored dry for 44 weeks (26.3% to 29.7%) suggested that
   the viability of seeds may have decreased. Dormancy could be a factor
   that decreased germination and can be removed by low temperature and
   GA(3) treatment. LT-SEM revealed a valley-like, sunken streak in empty
   seeds of P. cernua var. koreana. The nickel content in the trichome and
   seedcoat of full and empty seeds of both taxa ranged from 2.98 to 4.62
   (weight %), as determined on X-ray images. Our study suggested that the
   low germination rate was due to either the presence of dormancy, damage
   to either embryo or endosperm, a loss in viability, or the presence of
   nickel in the seeds.

   and chilling treatments on seed germination and seedling growth of

   GA3 was best when concerning the rooting rate and quality and the
   rooting rate was as high as 41.33%. Different root length of seeds with

   showed that chilling treatment (4°C) for 4 weeks, combined with 500
   mg.L-1 GA3 treatment was optimal for seed germination and seedling
   growth when the root length was less than 3 centimeter, and the seed
   germination was as high as 96.67%. This combination treatment could also
   make the time of seed germination be shorten to 48 days.

   Tukey's nutrient medium plus 1 or 3 mg/l GA3 and 2 or 4 mg/l IAA. Good
   germination of the kernels was obtained without stratification and no
   dormancy occurred at any of the sowing dates used; however, the growth
   regulator treatment reduced the germination time. These results show
   that olives have an optimum germination capacity when the kernels are
   taken at the hard green stage of fruit development, i.e. before dormancy
   begins.

AB In this study, the effects of different sowing environment (greenhouse
   and nursery), pretreatment (cold moist stratification), different sowing
   time (autumn, spring and summer) and some climate factors (air
   temperature, relative air humidity, soil temperature and soil moisture)
   on the germination of Acer pseudoplatanus L. seeds were studied. Seeds
   were harvested from the tree located in the Karadeniz Technical
   University campus. Three different germination trials were carried out;
   (1) direct sowing in autumn after seed collection (Control), (2) sowing
   stratified seeds in spring (Stratification-1) and (3) sowing stratified
   seeds in summer (Stratification-2). During the germination trial
   processes, air temperature, relative air humidity, soil temperature and
   soil moisture were measured periodicaly. Thus, the germination
   percentage changes in different sowing environments have been
   established on the basis of some climate factors. Higher germination
   percentages were obtained in the autumn (Control) compared to the spring
   (Stratification-1) and summer (Stratification- 2) sowings. The highest
   percentages of germination were -determined in the control trials (70%
   in greenhouse and 58% in nursery). Obtained germination results based on
   different sowing times revealed secondary dormancy in Acer
   pseudoplatanus L. seeds. It has been determined that the mean
   germination time in the greenhouse (12 days) was shorter than the mean
   germination time in the nursery (18 days). In addition, the obtained
   results showed that stratification and sowing time have a positive
   effect on the mean germination time in the greenhouse. Because of
   getting the best germination rates, keeping some climate -factors
   constant (21.0-24.9 degrees C air temperature; 17.0-19.9 degrees C soil
   temperature; 63.0-68.9% relative air humidity; 60.0-67.9% soil moisture)
   during the vegetative propagation practices in the greenhouse, should
   affect mass-seedling production in Acer pseudoplatanus L.

AB Echinacea (Echinacea ssp.) has been widely used in folk medicine for
   centuries and has a high market share and medicinal value, because more
   than 280 different products are sold economically in Europe. Generally,
   germination rate of Echinacea seeds is very low and poor seedling growth
   is an ongoing problem compared to other medicinal plants. Different
   methods were used before sowing that effect seedling quality which have
   positive effects on yield. In this study, the effects of stratification
   and moisturizing on the germination of Echinacea seeds were
   investigated. It was determined that stratification + moisturizing
   treatment at +4 degrees C with different day intervals (0, 5, 10, 15
   days) had a significant (p<0.01) effect on germination rates on seeds of
   Echinacea purpurea L. and Echinacea angustifolia L., besides the same
   effect was observed in epicotyl and hypocotyl lengths. Germination rates
   and seedling outflows were highest in moist seeds that kept at +4
   degrees C temperature for 15 days. It is clear from the study that
   stratification and moisturizing methods were efficient in breaking
   dormancy and also used methods were non-chemical, easily applicable and
   economically advantage for commercial plantations.

AB Hairy vetch (Vicia villosa) is an important cover crop and green manure
   in dryland cropping system of Mediterranean regions. A delay in the
   onset of rainfall during autumn can inhibit hairy vetch seed
   germination, which exposes its early growth stages to low-temperature
   stress. The present study was carried out in a completely randomized
   design with four replications to evaluate the effects of seed priming on
   germination of hairy vetch under chilling stress. The treatments were
   seed-priming type (unprimed, hydro-priming, halo-priming, and
   osmopriming) and temperature (3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 degrees C). The
   results indicated that a decrease in temperature produced a linear
   decline in the germination rate of seeds treated with halo-priming and
   osmopriming (p < .01). The seedling length, seedling dry weight, and
   vigor index decreased in plants experiencing chilling stress (quadratic;
   p < .01) for hydro-priming, halo-priming, and osmopriming. The maximum
   germination rate was achieved using hydro-priming. Osmopriming prevented
   a decrease in the rate of germination at 3 degrees C. A decrease in
   temperature increased the proline and the soluble protein contents in
   all the seed priming treatments, but, decreased catalase and guaiacol
   peroxidase activity (p < .01). In brief, halo-priming, and hydro-priming
   enhanced establishment and growth of hairy vetch under chilling stress
   primarily through improvements in the physiological parameters and
   germination rate. This finding can increase the potential for
   cultivation of the hairy vetch in late planting date.

AB This study was conducted in order to determine the appropriate treatment
   for breaking dormancy and the effect of salinity on seed germination of
   purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea cv. Magnus), in two separate
   experiments. In the first experiment, five levels of gibberellic acid
   (GA3) (0, 250, 500, 1000, and 1500 mg * L-1) with four levels of cold
   moist stratification period of seeds at 5°C (0, 5, 10 and 15 days) were
   launched. A factorial experiment was conducted in a completely
   randomized design with four replications. The statistical analysis
   showed that concentration of 250 mg * L-1 GA3 with 10 days of cold moist
   chilling significantly increased the percentage of germination of normal
   seedlings and reduced the mean time of germination. In the second
   experiment, the seeds were chilled for 10 days at 5°C and half of them
   treated with 250 mg * L-1 GA3 for 24 hours. The seeds treated with GA3,
   and those non-treated were subjected to NaCl for salinity stress. The
   experiment was conducted using five salinity levels (0, 20, 40, 60 and
   80 mM NaCl) in four replications in a completely randomized design. The
   results showed that purple coneflower is highly sensitive to salinity in
   the germination stage. The results also showed that by increasing
   salinity levels, the percentage of germination and normal seedlings
   significantly decreased and the mean time to germination increased,
   compared to the control treatment. But the seeds treated with GA3 showed
   higher viability and better performance under salinity stress condition.

AB The pits in the experiments were taken from ripe fruits and then air
   dried for 10 days. An attempt was made to determine whether any
   relations existed between the splitting of endocarps and germination of
   the seeds during stratification and the physiological changes in seeds
   and seedlings, which are typical of seeds undergoing after-ripening.
   Seeds stratified for 130 days at 6-9[degree]C were used. The pits whose
   endocarps did not split contained relatively little water, had the
   lowest catalase activity and produced typical dwarf seedlings. The pits
   with split endocarps contained more water and showed higher catalase
   activity and the seedlings produced were intermediate in the type of
   growth between normal and dwarf. The seeds already germinating were
   characterized by the highest content of water content of water and the
   highest catalase activity. The seedlings produced by them were entirely
   normal. The process of after-harvest ripening proceeded more uniformly
   in seeds planted in the field than in stratified seeds. This was due
   probably to the higher temperature in the field and to the diurnal
   fluctuations of the temperature. The process of after-ripening proceeded
   most uniformly, when during the 1st 100 days of stratification the seeds
   were kept 12 hours/day at 18[degree]C, and then the remaining hours at
   6-9[degree]C. The process of after-ripening took the least uniform
   course in this experiment when the pits during the whole period of
   stratification were kept at 4[degree]C. The intermediate values were
   obtained for the pits stratified at 6[degree]C. The pits kept during the
   same period in moist sand at 18[degree]C showed sporadic splitting of
   endocarps but did not germinate. In another experiment the influence on
   the course of ripening of the following stratifying media (at
   6-9[degree]C) was studied sand, moss (Poly-trichum commune), peat,
   sawdust from conifers and glass wool. No significant effect of these
   materials was observed on the uniformity of after-ripening of the seeds
   or their water content at the end of the stratification period. ||

AB Experiments were made on the influence of fruit rot, and various methods
   of pre-planting treatments on seed germination under field conditions.
   Pits from fruits of known parentage were used. Rotting of ripe fruits
   exerted a detrimental influence on the subsequent germination of seeds.
   When fruits were picked not fully ripe, and then allowed to rot, no ill
   effect on subsequent germination of the seeds was observed. Fall
   planting of the pits directly in the soil resulted in a markedly higher
   percentage of germination in the spring compared to that obtained by
   stratification at 6-9[degree]C and spring planting. Delaying the fall
   planting by 30 days resulted in decreasing the percentage of germinated
   seeds. The pits which were stratified at earlier dates germinated
   prematurely in large numbers, and were unable to grow later in the
   field. The generally low rate of growth of stratified pits was due to
   the ununiform course of after-ripening. In the experiment with different
   stratifying media the best results were obtained with moss. Better
   seedlings were obtained when the pits were stratified at 6-9[degree]C
   than at 4[degree]C. The pits collected from different trees produced
   significantly different numbers of seedlings. Those differences were
   most probably due to the genotypic variations in the trees. || ABSTRACT

AB Background. The European weed, introduced in Chile, Euphorbia lathyris,
   is a promissory bioenergy crop. However, the low percentage of seed
   germination is a limiting factor for the cultivation of this specie in
   Chile. Objectives: Our goal was to study the effect of temperature,
   light, and pre-germination treatments on E. lathyris seed germination.
   Methods: In vitro experiments were carried out with different conditions
   of temperature, light, and pre-germination treatments (hydration,
   stratification, mechanical, and acid scarification), in all cases the
   germination percentage and vigor index were compared. Results: The best
   germination results were obtained with hydration and germination in
   constant darkness at 23°C. Both mechanical and acid scarification, with
   sulfuric acid, and stratification had no effect to improve seed
   germination of E. lathyris. Conclusions: The germination rate of E.
   lathyris is affected by temperature, light, and pregerminative
   hydration.

AB We tested the hypothesis that seeds of the monocarpic perennial Ferula
   gummosa from the Mediterranean area and central Asia have deep complex
   morphophysiological dormancy. We determined the water permeability of
   seeds, embryo morphology, temperature requirements for embryo growth and
   seed germination and responses of seeds to warm and cold stratification
   and to different concentrations of GA(3). The embryo has differentiated
   organs, but it is small (underdeveloped) and must grow inside the seed,
   reaching a critical embryo length, seed length ratio of 0.65-0.7, before
   the seed can germinate. Seeds required 9 weeks of cold stratification at
   <10 degrees C for embryo growth, dormancy break and germination to
   occur. Thus, seeds have morphophysiological dormancy (MPD). Furthermore,
   GA(3) improved the germination percentage and rate at 5 degrees C and
   promoted 20 and 5% germination of seeds incubated at 15 and 20 degrees
   C, respectively. Thus, about 20% of the seeds had intermediate complex
   MPD. For the other seeds in the seed lot, cold stratification (5 degrees
   C) was the only requirement for dormancy break and germination and GA(3)
   could not substitute for cold stratification. Thus, about 80% of the
   seeds had deep complex MPD.

AB To evaluate the effects of different treatments on seed dormancy
   breaking of Notobasis, two separate experiments were conducted at
   Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources University of Khuzestan, in
   2017 with three replications. The first experiment included nine
   physical, mechanical and chemical treatments (control, surface
   scarification, intense scarification, one and two weeks of chilling at
   4°C, soaking into hot water for two hours without scarification, soaking
   in 25°C distilled water for two hours with scarification and acid
   treatment for six and 12 minutes) based on completely randomized designs
   (CRD). The Second experiment was hormone priming arranged as a factorial
   experiment based on completely randomized design with gibberellin
   concentrations (0, 200, 400, 600, 800 and 1000 ppm) and priming duration
   (12 and 24 hour) as the treatments. The highest seed germination (40%)
   obtained from 12 minutes of acid treatment. Results showed that seed
   germination reached to 100% after priming seeds with GA3 concentrations
   for 12 hours. However, increase the priming durations to 24 hours,
   significantly declined seed germination to 47% in 200 and 400 ppm of GA3
   concentrations. The Increase of GA3 concentrations in 12 hours led to a
   linear reduction of T50 from 31 hours in 200 ppm to 19 hours in 1000
   ppm. In 24 hours of priming treatment, T50 followed a Gaussian function
   and the highest T50 (92 hours) was obtained from 600 ppm. It is
   recommended to immerse the seeds for 12 minutes in sulfuric acid and
   prime with 400 ppm GA3 acid for 12 hours to break dormancy and increase
   the vigor index.

AB The aim of this study was to enhance the germination percentage and rate
   of Ferula assa foetida, a medicinally important vulnerable species,
   which have a low germination rate under normal laboratory conditions.
   The efficacy of different treatments including various levels of GA3,
   chilling and soaking with running water for germination improvement was
   tested. Analysis of variance indicated that Cold stratification and GA3
   concentration had significant effects on seed germination percentage.
   Combined treatments chilling (4°C) for both periods of 30 and 60 days
   were most effective in breaking dormancy. Among the combined chilling
   treatments, Maximum germination was obtained at combination treatment
   cold stratification (60 days) with 2000 ppm of GA3 solution and minimum
   germination was at socking in running water and control treatments.
   These results suggested that Ferula assa foetida seeds exhibit
   endogenous dormancy. A combination of cold stratifications and exogenous
   application of GA3 alleviated seed dormancy in a relatively short period
   of time. Germination rate was positively correlated with germination
   percentage.

   asses whether the non-germinability of dormant kernels is associated
   with failure in amino acid metabolism. Warm-incubated kernels showed low
   germination (25%), whereas cold-stratified kernels displayed germination
   up to 61%. Arginase activity increased about twofold in imbibed kernels.
   It remained at a high level in cold-stratified kernels from mid-period
   of incubation onwards; however, in warm-incubated kernels the activity
   declined after an initial increase so that by 20 days, it was
   negligible. No significant differences in GS activity occurred between
   cold-stratified and warm-incubated kernels, but the activity of GDH was
   significantly more in kernels incubated at warm conditions. Thin-layer
   chromatographic separation of polyamines revealed greater ammonia,
   spermidine and an unknown polyamine accumulation in warm-incubated
   kernels. Thus, the declined rate of walnut kernel germination under warm
   conditions is mainly correlated with rapid inactivation of arginase,
   greater levels of ammonia and alterations in kernel polyamine
   composition. The enhanced activity of GDH in warm-incubated kernels
   implies that catabolic deamination of amino acids and their subsequent
   respiration is the favored pathway ongoing under warm conditions. This
   situation compromises germination-specific metabolism of amino acids
   which likely to operate better at lower temperatures during cold
   stratification of kernels.

AB To investigate the germination of perennial herbaceous Astragalus, six
   species in different accessions were selected to be studied in a
   randomized complete block design in which three treatments including
   control, scarification and chilling were applied for one week with three
   replications. The study was carried out in the laboratory of Gene Bank
   at RIFR. Germination percentage, germination rate, plumule and radicle
   lengths, vigor index and ratio of radicle to plumule length were
   measured. All data were analyzed and the studied species showed
   significant differences in terms of the mentioned germination parameters
   except radicle length and ratio of radicle to plumule while differences
   among treatments were significant for all traits except radicle length.
   Interaction effects of species*treatment were also significant except
   radicle length and vigor index. Maximum and minimum values of
   germination traits were recorded for A. vegetus and A. lilacinus,
   respectively and other species were classified as average. The values of
   germination traits in chilling treatment were less than that in control
   treatment and it can be concluded that the cultivation of these species
   in autumn and winter may cause unsuccessful establishment. According to
   the results, A. vegetus was identified as a suitable species for range
   improvement in terms of most germination traits.

AB Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a warm season perennial grass that
   shows potential as a forage in the southeastern USA. Problems with
   switchgrass establishment from seed are often due to inherent seed
   dormancy from seeds harvested in fall and seeded the following spring.
   The objectives of this study were to determine (i) the effects of wet
   prechill (PC) treatment (5-degrees-C for 14 d) and scarification (8 M
   H2SO4 for 5 min) on germination of five switchgrass cultivars and (ii)
   the effect of plant growth regulators (ethylene, gibberellin, and
   kinetin), CO2, PC, and influence of storage temperature and duration on
   germination of four selected lots of Blackwell (BW) and Cave-in-Rock
   (CIR) seeds. Storage treatments were initiated 1 February using seeds
   harvested the previous fall. Early germination percentage (7 d) was
   increased between 22 and 73 by PC, while final germination percentage
   (28 d) was increased between 2 and 40. Germination of BW 6086 was
   increased from 60 to 63% by ethylene, and from 59 to 65% by gibberellin
   (alpha = 0.05). Seeds stored at -8-degrees-C showed little change in
   early or final germination with time of storage (90 d to 4 yr). Dormancy
   of BW 1198, BW 6086, and CIR 6012 was largely broken after 90 d of
   storage at 23-degrees-C. Germination of seeds stored at 23-degrees-C
   generally started to decline after 180 d to 2 yr. Postharvest storage of
   seeds at 23-degrees-C from january to April (90 d) should ensure
   adequate germination at time of seeding.

AB Erechtites valerianaefolia DC. (Asteraceae) is a Brazilian wild
   herbaceous species with economic and nutritive potential due to its high

   replications of 50 seeds each one, including stratification,
   scarification, different substrates, KNO3, sodium hypochlorite, seeds
   with different ages, light and darkness, as well as combinations of
   these treatments, with the objective of evaluating its germination
   pattern under laboratory conditions. The seeds of capicova are
   positively photoblastic and present higher germinability when collected
   during the winter season (April to September). The substrates, agar or
   filter paper, did not modify the germinability of the seeds. The use of
   KNO3 stimulated seed germination and decreased the average germination
   time. Sodium hypochlorite inhibited germination of seeds in 24% and
   retarded the process almost three days in relation to the control

   water, hydrogen peroxide, and GA(3); and the applications of different
   concentrations of GA(3) (0.5, 0.75 and 1 mg/l) in agar medium under in
   vitro conditions. Seed germination commenced after 5 and 10 days tinder
   in vivo and in vitro conditions, respectively. Significant differences
   were observed in the final percentage of seed germination between
   species and treatments in both experiments and which collectively showed
   that P. scoparia had the best germination capacity. Treatments with H2O2
   and GA(3) were significantly better in all populations with a higher
   percentage of germination in the in vivo stratification experiments. In
   addition, seed germination was affected by hormone concentration and
   revealed a clear difference with increasing GA(3) concentration in
   vitro. A combination of stratification and a pre-treatment with H2O2 and
   GA(3) reduced the germination time and promoted a higher germination
   rate of the stored seeds in the wild almond species studied.

   physiological characteristics of the velvetbean seedling under cold
   stress. Method: The velvetbean seeds were soaked with distilled water
   and cultured in the temperature-controlled culture box at 15, 20, 25,
   30, 35 and 40°C, respectively. The germination vigor was measured after
   4 days. The germination rate, germination index, and stem length, root
   length and number of lateral roots of the seedlings were measured after
   7 days to determine the optimum germination temperature. The seeds were
   soaked with different concentrations (0, 0. 5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5
   mmol/L) of SA. The germination temperature was controlled at 15°C and
   the growth temperature of the seedlings was controlled at 20°C. The
   germination vigor was measured after 4 days. The germination rate and
   germination index were determined after 7 days. Chlorophyll content, MDA
   content, SOD activity and POD activity of the seedlings were determined
   at two-leaf stage. Result: (1) The suitable temperature for germination
   of the velvetbeen seeds was 25-35°C. (2) Under cold stress, with the
   increase of exogenous SA concentrations, the germination rate,
   germination vigor, germination index, and activities of POD and SOD in
   the seedling leaves showed the trend of increase first and then the
   trend of decrease, but MDA content decreased first and then increased.
   There were no significant differences in Chlorophyll contents among
   different SA concentrations. Conclusion: In practice, the germination
   temperature for the velvetbean seeds should be controlled between
   25-35°C. SA can increase the chilling resistance of the velvetbean and
   the optimum treatment concentration of SA is 1.5 mmol/L.

AB Objective: In this study, the purpose was to study the response of
   cotton seeds to chilling stress, and to identify the chilling tolerance
   of different test varieties during the germination period in Gossypium
   hirsutum. We were also committed to analyzing the cold-tolerance
   characteristics of tolerant and sensitive varieties at the physiological
   levels, and to provide a reference for further research on the molecular
   mechanism of cold tolerance during the germination period. Method:
   Fifty-three upland cotton varieties were used to determine the
   imbibition rate and relative imbibition rate under chilling stress. In
   addition, we also measured the cold tolerance indexes such as
   germination index, vigor index, mean germination time, average
   germination speed, germination potential, germination rate, seed
   germination coefficient, radicle fresh weigh, radicle dry weight, embryo
   fresh weight, embryo dry weight, productive efficiency and material
   growth rate under chilling stress. We used correlation analysis,
   principal component analysis, membership function analysis and cluster
   analysis to comprehensively evaluate the 15 morphological indexes in the
   imbibition and germination stage. We also measured the changes in
   antioxidant enzyme activities, osmotic adjustment substance
   concentration and the expression of antioxidant enzyme genes between
   different cold-tolerant varieties under chilling stress. Result: Under
   chilling stress, the relative water absorption and water absorption rate
   of cotton seeds showed a downward trend, and the cold tolerance indexes
   of 53 cotton varieties showed significant differences. There was a
   strong correlation between imbibition rate and relative imbibition rate
   during the imbibition stage, and their correlations with other
   germination indicators were not significant or negatively correlated. In
   addition, the correlation analysis also found that indicators such as
   radicle fresh or dry weigh, vigor index, average germination speed and
   mean germination time could better reflect the cold tolerance of
   different varieties. Principal component analysis showed that three
   principal components could be obtained through simplification, with
   contribution rates of 55.17%, 18.27% and 8.79%, respectively. The
   results of membership function and clustering analysis showed that the
   53 varieties could be divided into four categories according to
   comprehensive evaluation value: high tolerant (5 varieties), tolerant
   (13 varieties), null-tolerant (26 varieties) and sensitive (9
   varieties), of which Xinluzhong4 and Zhong103026 are the most resistant
   and sensitive variety to cold stress, respectively. After chilling
   treatment, the activity of SOD, POD and CAT in the seeds of Xinluzhong4
   could be restored to the level close to or exceeding the control in a
   short time, the soluble protein concentration in Xinluzhong4 was
   significantly higher than that in Zhong103026. Gene expression analysis
   showed that the expression of GhPrx53 and GhCSD1 tended to be consistent
   with the changes of POD and SOD enzyme activity, respectively.
   Conclusion: The identification indexes of cold tolerance in upland
   cotton at the germination stage are diversified. The radicle fresh
   weight, radicle dry weight and vigor index can be used as positive
   indicators for cold tolerance, while the mean germination time and
   average germination speed can be used as negative indicator for cold
   tolerance during the germination period. Soluble protein concentration
   and the enzyme activities of POD, SOD and CAT can be used as
   physiological indicators for cold tolerance identification during cotton
   germination.

   appearance, thousand seed weight, water uptake ability, germination
   charecteristics and temperature stratification treatment. The results
   indicated that seeds of these 3 Ferula plants had rapid water uptaking
   ability, but with different seed germination rates. F. dissecta seed
   could germinate at normal temperature, but seeds of F. krylovii and F.
   sinkiangensis had seed dormancy with different degrees. Low temperature
   stratification could breake seed dormancy. The high and low temperature
   stratification treatments could effectively improve seed germination
   rate. Under high temperature treatment (25°C/15°C) for 14 d, then
   followed by low temperature treatment (4°C) for 42 d, F. krylovii seed
   germination rate could reach 46%. After high temperature treatment for
   42 d then followed by low temperature stratification treatment for 56 d,
   F. sinkiangensis seed germination rate could reach 64%.

AB Elucidating the regulatory mechanisms of environmental factors on seed
   dormancy and germination will provide guidance for tree regeneration.
   Toward understanding the coupled effect of light and temperature on
   dormancy release and germination of Pinus koraiensis seeds, we set up
   three light conditions (L200: 200 mu mol m(-2) s(-1), L20: 20 mu mol
   m(-2) s(-1), L0: 0 mu m(-2) s(-1)) and four storage temperatures [T-5: -
   5 degrees C (50 days), T5: - 5 degrees C (50 days) + 5 degrees C (50
   days), T25: - 5 degrees C(50 days) + 5 degrees C (50 days) + 25 degrees
   C (50 days), T15: - 5 degrees C (50 days) + 5 degrees C (50 days) + 25
   degrees C (50 days) + 15 degrees C (50 days)] using imbibed seeds, then
   quantified phytohormones gibberellic acid (GA(3)) and abscisic acid
   (ABA) during the stratification. Germination percentage (G(P)), mean
   germination time (T-M), and germination value (G(V)) under 25/15 degrees
   C temperature and the three light conditions were then determined.
   Phytohormone levels and germination performances were significantly
   affected by light and temperature. No consistent trend was found between
   the phytohormone levels and G(P) caused by light levels. Under the three
   light conditions, ABA concentrations in the embryo and endosperm
   decreased as storage temperature shifted from T-5 to T25 and increased
   from T25 to T15; GA(3 )decreased in nearly all four storage
   temperatures. G(P) reached 40-60% in T25 storage without light
   irradiance. In the three light conditions, G(P) and G(V) were higher at
   T5 and T25 than at T-5 and T15; so T5 and T25 are considered as optimum
   storage temperatures for dormancy release and germination. At optimum
   temperatures, light (L200, L20) significantly increased the G(P) and
   G(V) compared with the dark (L0). At L200 and L20, significant negative
   correlations between G(V) and the ABA concentrations and positive
   correlations between G(V) and GA/ABA in the seed embryo were found.
   Temperature played a more important role in primary dormancy release and
   germination; light was unnecessary for primary dormancy release. Light
   facilitated seed germination at optimum temperatures. The dormancy
   release and germination of P. koraiensis seeds were controlled by a
   decrease in ABA concentrations or an increase in GA/ABA induced by
   temperature variations.

AB Glycinebetaine (GB) seed priming enhances stress tolerance in various
   plants during the germination and seedling growth stage; however,
   information regarding turfgrass is limited. In this study, GB at 5 to 50
   mm was used to prime seeds of six turfgrass species to evaluate the
   potential of GB priming in enhancing tolerance to drought, salinity, and
   sub-optimal temperature during germination. Stress tolerance was
   determined as relative final germination percentage (FGP) and daily
   germination percentage (DGP), expressed as percentage of germination
   under stress conditions compared with the control treatment (i.e.,
   unprimed seeds germinated under non-stress condition) for each species.
   Daily germination percentage was more sensitive to stress than FGP.
   Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) showed high tolerance to drought,
   salinity, and chilling temperatures (5 and 10 degrees C below optimal
   germination temperature) followed by tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea
   Schreb.) and creeping bentgrass (Agrostis palustris L.), whereas
   kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.), bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon
   var. dactylon (L.) Pers.], and zoysiagrass (Zoysia japonica Steud.) were
   stress-sensitive. Kentucky bluegrass and bermudagrass showed higher
   germination at 10 GB under temperature stress and drought and
   temperature stresses, respectively; however, other grasses showed
   limited responses to seed priming. Our results showed that the efficacy
   of GB priming is plant-, GB concentration-, and stressor-dependent.

   technique. The effects of high/low temperature stratification and plant
   hormones on seed germination rate of C. deserticola were investigated
   using the orthogonal experimental design. Results showed that the seed
   germination rate was 6.7% at 50°C for 1 h and 1 week at 4°C twice
   repeated stratification treatment for the seeds, and the germination
   took 60 days. In contrast, the seed germination rate was 17.8% at 50°C
   for 1 h and 1 week at 4°C twice the repeated stratification treatment
   combined with 1.4 mol litre-1 of 6-BA, 2.9 mol litre-1 of GA3 and 5.8
   mol litre-1 of IBA treatment, and the germination needed only 30 days.
   GA3 was a key plant hormone to the seed germination to promote the
   germination rate at 50°C and 1 week at 4°C. Two repeated stratification
   treatments and exogenous plant hormone were the essential conditions for
   the seed germination after being excised from host.

AB Paris polyphylla var. yunnanensis is a traditional Chinese medicine and
   the morphophysiological dormancy in seeds severally limits the materials
   supply in pharmacy. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) comprise key regulatory modules
   in the process of seed dormancy and germination. However, little is
   known about the role of miRNAs during seed germination in this species.
   Here, P. polyphylla var. yunnanensis seeds were primed with 200 mg/L GA
   and incubated at constant 20 degrees C. This protocol caused to the
   initiation of seed germination in the 20th day and the achievement of
   80% germination rate in the 80th day. High-throughput sequencing was
   employed to identify and characterize miRNAs in six libraries (20d, 40d
   and 60d of germinating seeds) combined with their corresponding
   transcriptome data. A total of 293 known miRNAs and 692 putative novel
   miRNAs were identified based on the assembled 122,933 unigenes with the
   mean length of 1040 bp. The predicted targets of these miRNAs were
   enriched in the cell, metabolism and genetic information processing
   during seed germination, in which transport, primary metabolic process
   and translation were the most abundant, respectively. Our results will
   provide a new molecular basis about seed germination in P. polyphylla
   var. yunnanensis.

AB Leymus chinensis (Trin.) Tzvel., a perennial cool-season grass
   distributed widely in eastern Asia, is an ideal species for the
   rangeland industry and soil conservation, but the seed has a long
   dormant period and low germination rates. This study examined the
   effects of temperature, light and various treatments including
   stratification, H2SO4, NaOCl, gibberellic acid (GA(3)) and 6-benzyl
   adenine (13A), on the germination of Leymus chinensis seed. Seed stored
   over 1 yr and germinated at a temperature regime of 25/15 degrees C with
   a 12/12-h photoperiod germinated best, and had a germination rate of
   30.3%, with a minimum germination time of 12 d. In these germination
   conditions, germinated seeds were counted after 15 d to determine the
   effects of other treatments upon freshly harvested seed germination. The
   final germination rate for freshly harvested seeds stratified at 4
   degrees C for 0 to 10 wk ranged from 8.5 to 37.3%. Germination rates
   were 14.0 and 14.8% when seeds were treated with 70% H2SO4 for 3 and 6
   min, respectively. Seed treated with 5.0% NaOCl germinated 17.5 and
   16.0% when treated for 10 and 20 min, respectively. When seeds were
   soaked in 1000 mgL(-1) GA(3) solution for 24 h, 42.3% germinated, while
   treatment with 50 mgL(-1) of BA resulted in 50.3% germination. The
   results indicate that various dormancy mechanisms may exist in the
   species. These findings will be helpful to farmers and breeders in
   selecting suitable treatments to improve seed germination and
   establishment.

   NOVELTY - The method involves picking hybrid apples when approaching
   maturity. The hybrid seeds are taken out, thoroughly cleaned, aired, and
   preserved at room temperature. The hybrid seeds are soaked in tap water
   for 8 hours before stratification, disinfected with 1 % sodium
   hypochlorite for 30 minutes, flushed with sterile water 3 times, wrapped
   by 2 layers of wet gauze, put into dishes, and placed into a
   refrigerator at a set temperature of 2 DEG C for stratification. The
   seeds are flushed with tap water once every week in this period. The
   gauze for wrapping the seeds is kept wet but with no water accumulation.
   The seeds are transferred into an incubator at 25 DEG C for germination
   acceleration for 8-12 hours when radicle germinates by about 0.1 cm
   80-90 days later. The seeds are sown into seedling trays in a greenhouse

   ADVANTAGE - The method is strong in controllability. The germination
   rate reaches 95% or above. The method overcomes the defect that sand
   storage and stratification are affected by winter temperature,
   accurately controls the seed germination time, and achieves the aims of
   sowing the seeds earlier and accelerating the breeding process.

AB In order to learn dormancy mechanism of Taxus chinensis var. mairei
   seed, effects of stratification and hormone treatments on physiological
   and biochemical indexes of the seeds after stratifying for eight months
   were researched. The content of amylase activity and soluble sugar
   gradually increased at first stratification, and then to the maximum for
   the end of after-ripening period. With the dormancy of seed relieving,
   some soluble sugar of endosperm was used or consumed by respiration and
   that led to their content decreased. Seed soluble protein was gradually
   accumulated at the beginning of stratification and then the initial raw
   material of protein synthesis of embryo during development had been used
   or in part converted into carbohydrates for energy consumption, so that
   the soluble protein content decreased. The fat and starch content slowly
   decreased during stratification, which showed that the storage of
   material had continually carrying out catabolism and conversion, which
   might provide energy sources for seed germination in the stratification
   process. The peroxidase activity of Taxus seeds increased gradually at
   the beginning of stratification, and then reached maximum point during
   stratification for 4 months in A1 and A2. The G-6-PDH and 6-PGDH joint
   activity was rapidly increased to reach the maximum during
   stratification for 4 months in A1, which showed the pentose phosphate
   pathway was activated at this time. The peroxidase activity rapidly
   increased might also be related to respiratory metabolic pathway during
   stratification. In plants, acid phosphatase hydrolyze PAM metabolites,
   namely phosphate material was related to energy metabolism, especially
   to high-energy phosphate, and phosphate enzyme activity changes affected
   the energy metabolism. The acid phosphatase activity of Taxus seeds in
   different treatments has no significant changes during stratification
   process, but there were two maximums. Energy metabolism might get
   benefit from the increase of acid phosphatase activity. There were
   significant differences in amylase activity, peroxidase activity,
   soluble sugar and soluble protein content with different treatments.
   Effect of promoting seed germination soaked by GA before stratification
   was obvious, but the concentration of GA should not be too high. The
   high concentration of GA caused seed to rot and reduce the seed
   germination rate. In this study, the highest germination rate of seed
   was 71.8% and soaked in 200 mg.L-1 gibberellin.

   weight of per thousand seeds was 73.785 +- 1.249 g, and the average size
   of embryo was 2.66 +- 0.36 mm in length and 0.86 +- 0.13 mm in breadth.
   (2) The germination experiment revealed that the freshly harvested seeds
   was shown deep dormancy characteristics because they seriously delay
   their germination under moisture and at 25 degreeC conditions and only
   appeared little rupture of seed coat through 52 weeks. (3) The seeds
   were easy to loss water and to imbibe water. The water contents of
   washed seeds respectively came down to 26.93% and 12.52% under shady
   condition for 24 h and a week, but the absorbing water of seeds can went
   up 44.39% at 25degreeC for 24 h. It seemed that the seed coat was quite
   permeable. (4) The water extract from seeds could inhibit the
   germination of Brassica parachinensis. Comparison with germination in
   distilled water, the reduction of germination percentage of B.
   parachinensis by commensurate extract with 100 mg dry weight of seeds of
   per milliliter was called "relative germination inhibiting rate (R100)"
   in present study. The R100 of water extract of freshly harvested seeds

   (25 degreeC) stratification-low temperature (5 degreeC) stratification"
   for different corresponding duration: 12-36 weeks, 24-24 weeks, and

AB Lepidium apetalum was used to explore the characteristics and
   mechanismes of low temperature tolerance during seed germination. The
   results showed that pre-treatment the seeds at 4 degrees C would improve
   the seeds viability after stressed by low temperature at -5 degrees C
   and -10 degrees C and the capability of seeds tolerance to cold
   temperature became weaker along with germination development. Although
   the growth of radicle was inhibited significantly at 4 degrees C during
   germination, the seeds could still survive and grow. With appropriate
   time of stratified at 4 degrees C germination pace would be improved and
   germination rate would not change, while both of which decreased if
   stratification lasted too long. Moreover, L. apetalum seeds were very
   sensible to the temperature during germination. It showed no germination
   at 4 degrees C, while if seeds were stratificated for 48 hours at 4
   degrees C and subsequently treated with 25 degrees C for more than 6
   hours, seeds would germinate at 4 degrees C and the germination rate

   treatment at 25 degrees C was less than 5 houes, it showed no
   germinating. In addition, seeds with stratification for 10 days
   following 1 h treatment at 25 degrees C could also germinated at 4
   degrees C. The present study indicated that some pivotal genes that
   related with a key physiological stage before the onset of radicle
   protrusion might inhibite at 4 degrees C, which resulted in L. apetalum
   seed could not germinate at 4 degrees C. Except that physiological
   stage, the L. apetalum seed had a strong tolerance to low temperature at
   other germination stages. This experiment provided a new way to explore
   the germination mechanism of ephemerals plants seeds at low temperature.

AB The emergence of fruits and seeds of Lycium ruthenicum after low
   temperature stratification and storage at room temperature in dry
   conditions was investigated. Emergence rate, emergence potential,
   seedling index and recovery rate of germination under different
   intensities of drought stress and different planting depth in sand were
   simulated using PEG-6000 solution. The germination rate of seeds and
   fruits treated with PEG solution was increased by 60.00% and 16.66%
   respectively compared with the control. The time to emerge was reduced
   by 7 and 9 days respectively, indicating that low temperature
   stratification could effectively eliminate the dormancy of seeds and
   fruits of L. ruthenicum. High osmotic potentials (-0.03 to -0.10 MPa)
   did not influence emergence indicating that under mild drought stress,
   fruit germination was not affected by low temperature stratification.
   Both the seed and fruit were able to germinate after drought stress was
   relieved. It was concluded that the optimum sowing depth of seeds and
   fruits of L. ruthenicum is 1 and 3 cm respectively. It is also possible
   to successfully plant the fruit of L. ruthenicum rather than plant
   seedlings, saving time and labour.

   'Mo17 (chilling-sensitive). During imbibitional chilling stress at 5
   degrees C for 48 h. putrescine (Put) Content reduced, and spermidine
   (Spd), spermine (Spin) and malondialdehyde (MDA) increased in embryos of
   both the tolerant and sensitive maize inbred lines. However, at five
   stages (0, 12. 24. 36 and 48 h) of imbibition under chilling stress, the
   embryonic Spd and Spin of HuangC were higher than those of Mo17, whereas
   the contents of Put and NIDA in embryos of HuaugC were lower than those
   of Mo17 There were higher ratio of(Spd + Spm)/Put in HuangC than those
   of Mo17 in response to imbibitional chilling, stress. The values of (Spd
   + Spm)/Put were correlated negatively with the contents of MDA. Seed
   treatment by 0.5 mM exogenous put had no significant effects on
   embryonic MDA content and the germination ability (germination
   percentage. energy of germination and mean germination time) of HuangC
   and WIT Seed treatment by 0.5mM exogenous Spd and Spm significantly
   reduced MDA content, increased germination ability with various degrees
   in two maize inbred lines. 2.0 mM methylglyoxal-bis-(guanyl-hydrazone)
   (MGBG, a S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase inhibitor) treatment
   resulted in increase of MDA content, reduction of germination percentage
   and energy of germination and delay of germination in both maize inbred
   lines. The results suggest that Spd and Spm plays important roles in
   imbibitional chilling tolerance of maize seeds. probably through
   prevention of chill-induced MDA accumulation.

AB Chilling injury caused by low temperature happens frequently during seed
   imbibition in maize (Zea mays L.). Polyamines (PAs) such as putrescine
   (Put), spermindine (Spd), and spermine (Spm) are accumulated in plants,
   maintaining the stability and integrality of membrane under low
   temperature stress and eliminating free radicals in cells. They have
   been used by presoaking and leaf spray in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)
   and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) respectively to improve the tolerance
   to abiotic stresses. In the present study, Spd and Spm were used as an
   inducer to investigate chilling tolerance during seed imbibition and
   seed germination in maize. Seeds of maize inbred lines 'Hung C'
   (chilling-tolerant) and 'Mo17' (chilling-sensitive) were soaked with
   0.25 mmol L-1 of Spd and Spm, respectively for 72 h under dark at 15°C,
   and the control was not treated with PAs. Part of the seeds were
   germinated for 7 d under 25°C after imbibition for 48 h under 5°C in
   dark. The germination rates were tested every day with 4 replicates (25
   seeds per replicate) each. Other part of seeds were imbibed for 0, 12,
   24, 36, and 48 h, respectively at 5°C in dark. The embryos were
   separated from the seeds for testing the activities of peroxidase (POD),
   catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ascorbate peroxidese
   (APX) as well as the contents of proline (Pro), soluble protein, and
   nucleic acid in embryo leakage. All measurements repeated 3 times with
   15 seeds each time. Under chilling stress, both Spd and Spm treatments
   increased the activities of POD, CAT, SOD, and APX, raised soluble
   protein and Pro contents, and reduced nucleic acid content in embryo
   leakage. The treatments also increased seed germination percentage and
   shortened the mean germination time (MGT) which increased by 18.5% and
   14.0%, and decreased by 1.21 d and 1.14 d for Spd and Spm treatments,
   respectively as compared with those of control. During the imbibition
   under chilling stress, the activities of POD, CAT, SOD and APX, Pro and
   soluble protein contents in embryos and germination percentage were
   higher, whereas the content of nucleic acid and MGT were lower in
   untreated Huang C seeds than in untreated Mo17 seeds. The results
   suggested that Spd and Spm treatments can improve the chilling tolerance
   during seed imbibition, and enhance the germination of maize seeds.

   significantly enhanced the germination rate during the stratification
   treatment. The seed coat, particularly the mesophyll outer layer of the

   before treated with programmed cooling. The results showed that Nutlin-3
   enhanced the freezing tolerance of lettuce seeds after cooling (with the
   rate of 60°C /h). i. e, the germination rate of seeds imbibed with
   Nutlin-3 was higher than that of the control imbibition group, which was
   the most obvious when the temperature was reduced to be -20°C. This
   result indicated that in the process of programmed cooling, the
   regulation of ubiquitination was involved in the freezing resistance of
   seeds. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis of ubiquitin-related genes
   indicated that Nutlin-3 inhibited the expression of HOS1 and promoted
   the expression of anti-freezing factor ICE1 after cooling the seeds to
   be -20°C, E3 ubiquitin ligase gene COP1 was also promoted by Nutlin-3.
   At the same time, Nutlin-3 effected SOD activity, but had not effects on

AB Successful restoration of vegetation in dry valleys under strong
   anthropogenic disturbance in southwestern China is limited by lack of
   information on the germination requirements of many native plants,
   including some rose species. Effects of post-dispersal factors
   (temperature, moisture and light) on Rosa soulieana seed dormancy and
   germination were examined in order to predict the rate and timing of
   germination in the field. Dry storage, cold stratification, and warm
   plus cold stratification increased both germination percentages and
   germination rates. Warm plus cold stratification was most effective in
   breaking achene dormancy, followed by cold stratification and dry
   storage. Light during cold stratification had no effect on dormancy
   break. Germination occurred from 5 degrees C to 30 degrees C. At low
   temperature, diurnal alternating temperature (5/15 degrees C) was more
   effective than constant temperature (5 degrees C) in stimulating
   germination. Water stress significantly led to a decrease in germination
   percentage and rate. Significant differences under various photon
   irradiances were observed neither in germination percentages nor in
   germination rates. Temperature and moisture, but not light, appeared to
   play important roles in regulating dormancy and germination. Our results
   suggest that R. soulieana seeds may germinate sporadically from early
   spring to summer when soil moisture is sufficient for them to initiate
   this process. However, most achenes should normally germinate in the
   spring, which is a general phenomenon in plants. For effective
   restoration of degraded vegetation in dry valleys, it would be
   recommended to sow fresh achenes in autumn or achenes with dormancy
   broken in laboratory in early spring and relatively deep in the soil.

AB The WRKY transcription factor plays an important regulatory role in
   plant responses to biotic and abiotic stressors. In this study,
   ClWRKY20, whose expression was strongly induced by chilling in
   watermelon, was isolated and characterized. ClWRKY20 belongs to group
   III of the WRKY family. The subcellular localization analysis found that
   ClWRKY20 was localized only in the nucleus. Expression characteristic
   analysis found that it was upregulated in response to drought, salt, and
   exogenous phytohormones, including salicylic acid (SA), ethylene (ET),
   and abscisic acid (ABA). The overexpression of ClWRKY20 enhanced the
   salt and low-temperature tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis determined
   through apparent symptoms and physiological analyses of the root growth,
   the lethal rate, the relative electrical leakage, MDA and proline
   contents, the seed germination rate, and the Fv/Fm value. Furthermore,
   the ClWRKY20 overexpression lines showed increased sensitivity to ABA
   during seed germination, while did not at the seedling stage. The RNA
   sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR analyses revealed that several
   stress-related genes induced by chilling stress in wild-type plants were
   also upregulated by the overexpression of ClWRKY20 in transgenic plants,
   relative to their expressions in the WT Arabidopsis. Additionally,
   transcript levels of several genes involved in the ABA signaling
   pathway, in the ethylene biosynthetic and ethylene signaling pathway, in
   the jasmonic acid biosynthesis and jasmonate signaling, or related to
   auxin transport and auxin-responsive, were significantly increased in
   the transgenic Arabidopsis compared with that in the WT plants. Taken
   together, ClWRKY20 positively modulated plant tolerance to salt and low
   temperature stresses, and the enhanced chilling tolerance in transgenic
   Arabidopsis was accompanied by the increased expressions of
   stress-related genes. Moreover, ClWRKY20 not only modulated chilling
   responses through ABA signaling, but also might function as an
   integrator among several signaling pathways.

AB A systematic study was conducted to explore the causes of seed dormancy
   in European hornbeam (Carpinus betulus). European hornbeam seeds undergo
   combinational dormancy: the mature seed has a complete configuration,
   but the embryo requires after-ripening, which is the main cause of
   dormancy. The seed coat of the European hornbeam seeds is very hard and
   dense, which hinders water absorption to some degree. The seed coat also
   contains some germination inhibitors. We found that soaking the seeds in
   500 mg L-1 GA3 could increase the germination rate and concentrated
   sulfuric acid scarification could significantly reduce the time of
   stratification.

AB The aim of the present work was to investigate the effects of
   osmoconditioning on chilling injury in chilling-sensitive soybean
   (Glycine max (L.) Merr. Zhonghuang No. 22) seeds during imbibition. Low
   temperatures reduced the germination rate and no seed germinated at 1
   degrees C. Osmoconditioning of seeds at 20 degrees C with a polyethylene
   glycol-8000 (PEG8000) solution at 1.5 MPa for 72 h followed by drying
   back to their initial moisture content (MC) reduced their chilling
   sensitivity. The phenylarsine oxide (PAO), an inhibitor of protein
   tyrosinephosphatases, was used to investigate the possible involvement
   of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation of Tyr residues in the plasma
   membrane composition and function when seeds were osmoconditioned. The
   results showed the germination of osmoconditioned seeds decreased
   significantly when PAO was added in PEG solution after chilling
   treatment. PAO inhibited changes in composition of plasma membrane
   phospholipids and fatty acid induced by osmocondition, indicated that
   tyrosine protein phosphorylation is involved in the regulatory
   mechanisms of osmocondition-responsive chilling in soybean seeds.
   Western blot result further indicated that osmocondition treatment
   improved the activity of plasma membrane H+-ATPase after chilling
   treatment, but this effect was abolished by PAO. The possible regulation
   mechanism by Tyr protein phosphorylation is discussed.

AB A healthy crop is desirable in direct seeded vegetables to ensure good
   quality of the produce and is affected by a number of environmental and
   cultural factors. A number of seed treatments had been used to enhance
   the performance of seeds in several crops. Alternate cycles of dry heat
   and chilling (thermal hardening) is one of these seed treatments, used
   in cereals to invigorate the seeds, but reports about such treatments in
   vegetable crops are scarce. Therefore, seeds of cabbage varieties Golden
   Acre (GA) and Green Ball (GB), varying in their germination (%) and
   vigour, were exposed to different temperature (-20 and 40 degrees C) and
   duration (24, 36 and 48 hrs) regimes and the effect of these treatments
   on seed vigour was evaluated. Different thermal hardening treatments,
   especially H-C 24 hrs, C-H 36 hrs, C-H-C 24 hrs and C-H-C 48 hrs,
   increased final germination percentage (FGP), power of germination and
   seedling vigour. These treatments decreased the germination spread over
   time in cabbage variety GB. However, such response was not observed in
   GA that already had high seed vigour. The impact of these better
   performing treatments was evaluated on germination and vigour of GA
   seeds under saline conditions. Interestingly, mean germination time and
   time taken for 50% germination was less for C-H 36 hrs and C-H-C 24 hrs
   treated seeds at all salinity levels. These seed treatments (H-C 24 hrs,
   C-H 36 hrs, C-H-C 24 hrs and C-H-C 48 hrs) improved vigour index at all
   salinity levels except at 200 mM NaCl concentration. Overall results
   depicted that C-H 36 hrs and C-H-C 24 hrs were more effective than other
   treatments to impart salinity tolerance and can be used as a safe tool
   for direct seeding of cabbage crop under normal and saline conditions.

AB Low and erratic seed germination of Heliopsis helianthoides (L.) Sweet
   have hindered breeding efforts. The objectives of this study were to
   characterize seed dormancy and to investigate factors (cold
   stratification, ethylene, gibberellic acid, priming, and red light) as
   potential germination enhancers. Physiological, but not physical nor
   morphological seed dormancy was found. Cold stratification (1-6 weeks),
   imbibing seeds in ethephon (1-5 mM), and red light exposure (1.5 h) all
   contributed favourably to cumulative germination at 2 weeks, and cold
   stratification and ethephon also promoted quicker germination.
   Germination enhancement for any of the factors was variable and depended
   on seed lot and duration of seed storage prior to experiments. As
   storage time increased, seed dormancy decreased and seeds germinated
   more readily with less sensitivity to germination cues. Gibberellic acid
   (500 mgl(-1)) treatments were not significantly different than water
   controls. Priming seeds in water, KNO3 (0.5%), and ethephon (1 mM) for
   12 h, drying, and reimbibing in water resulted in reduced germination
   and increased pathogen attack. Imbibing dormant seeds of H.
   helianthoides with ethephon (1 -5 mM), followed by exposure to red light
   (1.5 h), and at least one week of cold stratification (4 degrees C) is
   recommended in order to promote both fast and maximum germination.

   Thunb., a member of the family Fagaceae a critically endangered species
   from the Himalayan region of Pakistan. Seeds of the species were
   collected from Mansehra, Batagram and Muzaffarabad Districts in
   November, 2013. Mature and ripened seeds were collected in suitable
   season from the selected sampling sites in polythene bags. Some of these
   collected seeds were scarified while others were subjected to
   stratification treatment only. Stratified treatments were given to the
   seeds for 10, 15 and 20 days in the laboratory. Others were scarified
   with knife and forceps. In stratified seeds, maximum germination rate
   i.e. 95.45% were observed in seeds collected from Batagram District
   while the lowest rate was observed in seeds collected from Mansehra
   District. Like-wise, for scarified treatment, maximum germination rate
   i.e. 100% was obtained in seeds collected from Batagram and Mansehra
   districts while in Muzaffarabad District lowest rate of germination i.e.
   83% was observed. Scarified treatments proved to be more effective for
   this species as compared to stratified treatments. Therefore, these
   methods should be followed for the seed germination practices of these
   species and regeneration on larger scale.

AB Proline (Pro) is not only an important osmotic adjustment substance, but
   it also plays an important role in regulating plant abiotic stress
   resistance. The maize varieties, Xinxin 2 (low temperature insensitive)
   and Damin 3307 (low temperature sensitive), were chosen as materials,
   setting a normal temperature for germination (22 degrees C/10 degrees C,
   9d), low temperature germination (4 degrees C/4 degrees C, 5d) and
   normal temperature recovery (22 degrees C/10 degrees C, 4d), combined
   with a proline (15 mmol.L-1) soaking treatment, to reveal the seed
   germination and regulation mechanism in maize embryos. The results
   showed that proline significantly improved the germination potential,
   germination rate, germination index and vigor index of seeds under low
   temperature stress, increasing the length of the coleoptile and radicle,
   increasing the dry and fresh weight of young buds (coleoptile +
   radicle), and increasing the activity of alpha-amylase. Proline enhanced
   the activities of Delta 1-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid synthetase (P5CS)
   and ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) in maize embryos under low
   temperature stress, enhanced the proline synthesis pathways, and further
   enhanced proline accumulation. Proline induced the activity of proline
   dehydrogenase (ProDH) in the early stage of low temperature stress and
   stress relief. Under low temperature stress, the activities of
   hexokinase (HXK), phosphofructokinase (PFK), pyruvate kinase (PK),
   isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), malate
   dehydrogenase (MDH) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) and
   glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH and 6-P-GDH) in maize embryos
   were decreased, resulting in a decrease in the glycolysis (EMP) pathway,
   tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP).
   Proline alleviated the inhibition of key enzyme activities of the EMP
   pathway, TCA cycle and PPP of maize embryos under low temperature
   stress, increased the activities of cytochrome oxidase (COX) and
   alternative oxidase (AOX), increased the ATP content, alleviated the
   inhibition of low temperature stress on main cytochrome pathway activity
   (rho V-cyt), while further increasing the total respiratory activity
   (V-t) and the actual operational activity of the alternative pathway
   (rho V-alt) during seed germination at the initial stage of low
   temperature stress, as well as improving the inhibition of the V-t and
   rho V(alt )in the middle and late stages of low temperature stress.
   Under low temperature stress, the content of abscisic acid (ABA)
   increased significantly, while gibberellin (GA), auxin (IAA) and zeatin
   nucleoside (ZR) decreased significantly. Proline alleviated the decrease
   in IAA, ZR and GA contents in maize embryos under low temperature
   stress, reduced the increase in the ABA content, and reduced the
   inhibition of low temperature on seed germination.

AB As an important medicinal plant, American ginseng has high value.
   However, its deep dormancy makes it difficult to propagate from seeds.
   Previous studies on American ginseng seeds mostly focused on
   morphophysiological dormancy: the under-developed embryo in the seeds
   has physiological dormancy. GA(3) was used to accelerate the process of
   breaking physiological dormancy of American ginseng seeds in this study.
   Through the observation of seed morphology and the detection of various
   physiological indexes during cold stratification, the mechanism of
   American ginseng seeds breaking physiological dormancy was studied.
   After 100 days cold stratification, the germination of GA(3)-treated
   split seeds was 76.67%, which was significantly higher than that of the
   control group (10.67%). The peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and
   glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase content of GA(3)-treated American
   ginseng seeds decreased significantly, but showed an upward trend during
   cold stratification. It is speculated that GA(3) promotes the release of
   physiological dormancy by changing the accumulation of reactive oxygen
   species in American ginseng seeds.

   endodormancy period. The germination rate was 50% or more in all
   treatments except of ‘Hongro’ -5oC treatment. The germination rate of
   ‘Fuji’ was 86.3% at the temperature of -5oC. The concentrations of
   carbohydrate and mineral components were significantly different between
   treatments but did not show any tendency or specific change. However,
   the sorbitol contents of ‘Hongro’ -5oC treatment were higher at 29.62
   mg/g than those of ‘Fuji’, which was not affected for dormancy release.
   The results of hormone analysis showed that ABA(abscisic acid) and
   JA(jasmonic acid) in ‘Hongro’ -5oC treatment were respectively 176.48
   and 15.72 ng/g. ABA, JA and SA(salicylic acid) contents in 'Fuji' apple
   tree were significantly lower than those of ‘Hongro’. As a result of
   this study, the limit temperature range effective for dormancy release
   was different according to the varieties, and ‘Hongro’ did not affect
   with 30.3% of germination rate at -5oC. However, ‘Fuji’ is 86.3% even at
   -5oC it was suggested that ‘Fuji’ had a chilling accumulation for
   dormancy release.
