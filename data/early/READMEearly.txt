OEGRES2020.xlsx received to Lizzie (EMW) from Dan Buoniauto on 23 April 2021. Here's the email (note that WOS, Web of Science, is an ISI product):

Attached is the spreadsheet I started for OEGRES.

I never scraped any day, but went through a bunch of studies to see if they met my criteria. I did most of them from the WOS core collection (tab 2) and then re-ran the search again in the full collection (tab 1).

The search terms were "germination" and "stratification".
The meta data is highlighted in yellow on the excel worksheet. Let me know if you have any questions.
