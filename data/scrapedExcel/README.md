# Scraped data file README:

This folder contains the original data files scraped as part of the EGRET meta-analysis. Files were scraped by multiple undergraduate and graduate students in the Wolkovich lab from 2022-2024.

## File tabs:

Each file contains four tabs:
1. meta_general: lists columns in the various files and relevant meta-data
2. source: list of source information for each paper that we reviewed/will scrape
3. data_detailed: where new data and related information is recorded, this tab is saved as a .csv file and duplicated in the data/ and analyses/input folders
4. scratch: for formatting data when entering it
