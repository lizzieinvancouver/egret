Deirdre Loughnan correctly identified that veatch-blohm11 was never done, but EMW (Lizzie) started it in November 2023. I got very close but never finished it so I am uploading my files into egret_EMW/ folder now and *strongly suggest* that Mao rename it as egret_XM/ and use it for her paper.

Here is what I think I did:
(1) Took notes on the paper (below).
(2) Scraped the data from tables into veatch-blohm11.csv (this is timestamped as created 5:22pm on 27 Nov 2023 and last modified at 6:05pm on 27 Nov 2023). I then did some work to modify the scraped data and used Excel as best I can tell (veatch-blohm11.xlsx created and last modified at 6:05pm on 27 Nov 2023). 

So next, someone needs to check what I have and organize it to fit into the EGRET datasets.

TO DO (from Nov 2023 by Lizzie): 
	- What website to get lat/lon when not given?
	- What to do when storage is defined as after-ripening treatment?
<><><><><><><>

Arabidopsis lyrata ssp. lyrata
biennial/perrennial 
3 populations:
	Pilot Preserve Maryland (60 plants sampled)
	Soldiers Delight Serpentine Barrens Maryland (60 plants sampled)
	Perry Preserve in Dover Plains NY (100 plants sampled)
2 years of sampling: 2007 and 2008 (late June-early July)
Seeds went into dry storage at 23 +/- 2 C for after-ripening and were removed for germination testing at 1/4/8/11/ months
5 strat: 0/1/2/3/4 days at 4C in dark

20 seeds from each of two half-sib families were removed from packets and pooled within each population for germination tests

Seeds were sterilized for 3 minutres at 50% ethanold-Tween mixture then ...
Rinsed with 90% ethanol (allowe dto evaporate before seeds were sown)

20 seeds from a dsingle populatins were sown on 10 cm petri dishes which contained two filter paper disks sturalied with 6 mL of distilled water. Platres seale diwth parfilme and placed in cold rom at 4C for strat. 

Each treatment was repped 4 times (I think that means 4 petri plates?)

After all this they want into:
Growth chambers (EGC M12) at 20C day/night of 14/10h and light of 120 mol protons m-2s-1

Monitored germination daily for 14 d.
Measured:
	Germination percent 
	Germination rate (following Maguire 1962: G1/D1 + Gf/Df where G1 to Gf are number of seeds germinated on first to final days of counting (D1 to Df))
