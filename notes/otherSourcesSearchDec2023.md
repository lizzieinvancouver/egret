At the first EGRET retreat (in November 2023) we realized we had so few woody species that we should consider other ways to pull data (beyond our current approach of scraping the white literature).

Lizzie, Dan, Deirdre and Fredi worked on this, dividing up common genera and searching refs in Baskin and Baskin Seeds book and also in USDA Woody Plant Seed Manual. (Lizzie's personal files and notes on this are in notposting/otherSourcesSearch.) After a fair bit of work and meetings, we decided to just scrape the USDA Woody Plant Seed Manual, which was started in 2024.
