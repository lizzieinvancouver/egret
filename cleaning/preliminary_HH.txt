	1. Combine data from all
	2. From the figure preliminary_HH/overview.png, we seems to have sufficient data
	3. From the figure preliminary_HH/region.png --> data clusters, note that the map only include studies with lat long info -- will find a way to integrate continent
	4. Tasks:
		+ Fill in year germination
		+ Clean storage -- what to do if there are 2 storage schemes? Temp fluctuation? What is room temp? Remove containers? Format sync + Differentiate between strat & stored?
		+ Sync respvar and germ.tim.zero
		+ Look into treatment + other treatment -- CHALLENGE: some are filled before we added new columns
		+ Lat long range
		+ Chill (strat) -- continuous/alternating -- Should we split into stages?
		+ Germination -- Germ during strat -- chill.temp or germ.temp? A few neg values for germ.duration
		+ Photoperiod -- Small fix for alternating a/b
		+ Chemical -- Should we split into stages?
		+ Not many studies have scarification (~ 36/171), Sync scar type
		+ Differentiate between soaking and chemical, Format sync
