How to fix cleaning files ....

coordinate_cleaning_TA.R 
	1) UPDATE to master data file (and delete all the code that reads in piecemeal data)
	2) Decide what of the name cleaning and early cleaning should stay
	3) Mv the code that averages ranges to a separate file for now
	4) Clean up the lat/lon code (standardize white space)
	5) Figure out what is happening at the end of the code, and decide to keep or not
	6) Add comments 
	7) Subset by continent and make sure points end up in correct continent 
	8) Eventually source in a pipeline cleaning file 
	9) Rename! And move to source folder


cleaningDL.R 
	1) Deirdre will fix to be master file -- read in all input as csv.	
	2) Extract out any code that does separate things and make as separate file (give good names and put in source folder). 
		- clean_species.R
		- clean_other.R (column cleaning) 

cleaningJS.R
	1) UPDATE to master data file (and delete all the code that reads in piecemeal data) 
	2) Delete all the species name cleaning (it's copied)
	3) Variously add remaining to 
		- clean_other.R
		- clean_misc.R (random entry cleaning)


preliminary_DM.R 
	1) UPDATE to master data file (and delete all the code that reads in piecemeal data) 
	2) Save some the stuff about 95% and plotting (after getting it to run and moving where the figures go) to a new file.
	3) Rename as checkdata_distributions.R


preliminary_HH.R
	1) UPDATE to master data file (and delete all the code that reads in piecemeal data) 
	2) Some might move into a cleaning file ... check! Move etc.
	3) Move the mapping code into new file
	4) Rename as checkdata_maps. R
