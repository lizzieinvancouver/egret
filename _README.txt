Aim of database: We want to understand the cues (factors/treatments etc.) that control germination of woody species, probably especially non-tropical species, but let's start by seeing how much info there is on woody species before we limit further. 

OEGRES -- Dan's name, I think it's Observed E--- Germination Responses to Experimental S---- I am shortening to OGRES, and awaiting a lab-agreed-upon name. 


UPDATED 1 June 2022

After Dan (B) and Sophia Collins worked on this all spring, we agreed we should try new search terms and start anew. Dan worked through several searches and we together selected the best ones. See OEGRES_searchnotes.txt

Some notes from Dan that I am organizing (as of June 2022):

Next Steps:
-Check abstracts/papers
  Include if there is an independent environmental treatment:
    example: cold stratification for 0 or 30 days

  Don't include:
    -No variation in enviromental treatment:
      e.g. treatment 1 control, treatment 2 GA3, and both were stratfied for 30 days.
or
    -Environmental treatments are not independent of non-enviromnetal treatment
        e.g.  treatment 1: 5 ML of GA3, treatment 2 10: ML of GA3, 30 vs 60 days of stratificaton

Examples of non-environmental treatments:
-hormone applications 
- mechanical scarification

Examples of environemntal treatments
- cold stratification
- warm stratification
- after-ripening
-light levels/period
-incubation temperature (the temperature conditions during the germination period)
- water content, osmotic potential etc

Note: many studues use both enviromental and non-enviromental treatments, for example you might have:
  -control
  -GA3
  -30 days stratification
  -GA3+ 30 days stratification.
You still want to include this study, because you could extract data for the control and 30 day stratification treatment.


More Notes:
Not cross checking with Sophia and Alinas list.
All species, not just woody.

Stuff to do while checking papers:
Column for genus/species
Criteria for rejection/acceptance
English language only
Available v. Interlibrary loan

Baskin: 
- We discussed how hard it may be to cross-check our list with the Baskin ref list (Willis list does not include reference and the book is in text form only so we would have to scrape it).
- We decided: we can say we did not scrape it as long as we either on woody species (they divide stuff by habitat not growth form), or we focus on time to germination (they focus on dormancy classification which is often done by showing a marked increase in percentage after a treatment)

NEXT STEPS!
- EMW starts a spreadsheet with what we want everyone to enter, and does XX papers then passes to Deidre and Dan to quickly add to then we get to UGs. 
- After that, pass to UGs to hopefully do quickly. 
- Because then we want to enter the data.
