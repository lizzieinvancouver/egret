Aim of database: We want to understand the cues (factors/treatments etc.) that control germination of woody species, probably especially non-tropical species, but let's start by seeing how much info there is on woody species before we limit further. 

OEGRES -- Dan's name, I think it's Observed E--- Germination Responses to Experimental S---- I am shortening to OGRES, and awaiting a lab-agreed-upon name.

EGRET -- Deirdre's name -- Environmental Germination Responses to Experimental Treatments -- could also be Eudicot instead of environmental

After Dan (B) and Sophia Collins worked on this all spring, we agreed we should try new search terms and start anew. Dan worked through several searches and we together selected the best ones. See OEGRES_searchnotes.txt

Some notes from meeting with Dan, Lizzie, Deirdre (late May 2022):

More Notes, we decided that we are ... 
- Not cross checking with Sophia and Alina's list.
- Doing all species, not just woody.

Baskin: 
- We discussed how hard it may be to cross-check our list with the Baskin ref list (Willis list does not include reference and the book is in text form only so we would have to scrape it).
- We decided: we can say we did not scrape it as long as we either on woody species (they divide stuff by habitat not growth form), or we focus on time to germination (they focus on dormancy classification which is often done by showing a marked increase in percentage after a treatment)
